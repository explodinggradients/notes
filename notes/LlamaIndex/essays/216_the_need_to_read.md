# 216 The Need to Read

 In the science fiction books I read as a kid, reading had often been replaced by some more efficient way of acquiring knowledge. Mysterious "tapes" would load it into one's brain like a program being loaded into a computer.   
  
 That sort of thing is unlikely to happen anytime soon. Not just because it would be hard to build a replacement for reading, but because even if one existed, it would be insufficient. Reading about x doesn't just teach you about x; it also teaches you how to write. [1]   
  
 Would that matter? If we replaced reading, would anyone need to be good at writing?   
  
 The reason it would matter is that writing is not just a way to convey ideas, but also a way to have them.   
  
 A good writer doesn't just think, and then write down what he thought, as a sort of transcript. A good writer will almost always discover new things in the process of writing. And there is, as far as I know, no substitute for this kind of discovery. Talking about your ideas with other people is a good way to develop them. But even after doing this, you'll find you still discover new things when you sit down to write. There is a kind of thinking that can only be done by [_writing_](words.html).   
  
 There are of course kinds of thinking that can be done without writing. If you don't need to go too deeply into a problem, you can solve it without writing. If you're thinking about how two pieces of machinery should fit together, writing about it probably won't help much. And when a problem can be described formally, you can sometimes solve it in your head. But if you need to solve a complicated, ill-defined problem, it will almost always help to write about it. Which in turn means that someone who's not good at writing will almost always be at a disadvantage in solving such problems.   
  
 You can't think well without writing well, and you can't write well without reading well. And I mean that last "well" in both senses. You have to be good at reading, and read good things. [2]   
  
 People who just want information may find other ways to get it. But people who want to have ideas can't afford to.   
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
  **Notes**   
  
 [1] Audiobooks can give you examples of good writing, but having them read to you doesn't teach you as much about writing as reading them yourself.   
  
 [2] By "good at reading" I don't mean good at the mechanics of reading. You don't have to be good at extracting words from the page so much as extracting meaning from the words.
