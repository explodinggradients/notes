# 015 What Languages Fix


  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 Kevin Kelleher suggested an interesting way to compare programming languages: to describe each in terms of the problem it fixes. The surprising thing is how many, and how well, languages can be described this way.   
  
 

 **Algol:** Assembly language is too low-level.   
  
  **Pascal:** Algol doesn't have enough data types.   
  
  **Modula:** Pascal is too wimpy for systems programming.   
  
 **Simula:** Algol isn't good enough at simulations.   
  
  **Smalltalk:** Not everything in Simula is an object.   
  
  **Fortran:** Assembly language is too low-level.   
  
  **Cobol:** Fortran is scary.   
  
  **PL/1:** Fortran doesn't have enough data types.   
  
  **Ada:** Every existing language is missing something.   
  
  **Basic:** Fortran is scary.   
  
  **APL:** Fortran isn't good enough at manipulating arrays.   
  
  **J:** APL requires its own character set.   
  
  **C:** Assembly language is too low-level.   
  
  **C++:** C is too low-level.   
  
  **Java:** C++ is a kludge. And Microsoft is going to crush us.   
  
  **C#:** Java is controlled by Sun.   
  
 **Lisp:** Turing Machines are an awkward way to describe computation.   
  
  **Scheme:** MacLisp is a kludge.   
  
  **T:** Scheme has no libraries.   
  
  **Common Lisp:** There are too many dialects of Lisp.   
  
  **Dylan:** Scheme has no libraries, and Lisp syntax is scary.   
  
 **Perl:** Shell scripts/awk/sed are not enough like programming languages.   
  
  **Python:** Perl is a kludge.   
  
  **Ruby:** Perl is a kludge, and Lisp syntax is scary.   
  
  **Prolog:** Programming is not enough like logic.
