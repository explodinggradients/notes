## Open Partner Track Description

Resellers, integrators and other sales and services partners join the
partner program in the Open track. Open is for all partners in the DevOps
space, or ItaaS and other adjacent spaces that are committed to investing
in their DevOps practice buildout. Also, the Open track is for partners seeking
to develop customers or just wanting to learn about Gitlab and participate in
the Gitlab partner community. GitLab Open Partners may or may not be
transacting partners, and can earn product discounts or referral fees.

## Contacting Support

Open Partners may contact us on behalf of one of their customers by submitting
a ticket. To ensure proper
ticket routing, which helps to prevent first response delays, they should:

1. use [this specialized form](https://support.gitlab.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000818199)
1. verify that the customer already has a contact record in Salesforce that is
   associated with the correct account record

Zendesk will use the information in the form to change the `requester` field to
contain the name of the partner's customer. The reason for this is that GitLab
Support works directly with an Open Partner's customer, using the customer's
support plan level, **not the partner's**.

If an Open Partner wants to be involved in a ticket, they should indicate that
within the `Description` of the ticket when they are submitting it. In
response, we will add them to the CC list of the ticket.

**Note to Support**: Never associate a customer to an Open Partner's
organization, or vice-versa!

## File uploads

When Open Partners needs to send support files, we have 2 methods
available to accommodate this:

- Standard ticket uploads (20MB max)
- [Support Uploader](https://about.gitlab.com/support/providing-large-files/#support-uploader)

## Examples of Support Ticket Submission and Handling for Open Partners

Support provided to Open Partners and their customers will vary depending on
the circumstances under which a ticket is raised. Some examples are:

1. An Open Partner raises a ticket, using the Open Partner form, on behalf of
   their end customer. They should do so under the Customer's account. We will
   deliver support **based on the customer's subscription**. Support will
   correspond with the end customer directly. Please note that if the partner
   incorrectly types the customer's email address, the ticket may not be
   properly associated with the customer organization. This can be corrected
   with the following steps:

    1. Update `Organization Email (partners)` to use the correct email
    1. Change `Requester` by clicking `change` link under the ticket subject
    1. Submit the ticket to save your changes

1. Same example as above, except this time the Open Partner is fulfilling a
   services engagement for their end customer, and so needs to be included in
   the ticket work. In the partner troubleshooting section of the form, the
   partner should ask to be included in the CC list on the ticket in question.

1. An Open Partner is doing commercial work for a customer and raises a
   ticket. They should do so under their own account using a subscription
   they have purchased for themselves. We will deliver support **based on the
   subscription the partner has purchased**.

1. An Open Partner is doing internal training, testing or knowledge
   building. They should raise a ticket under their account using their
   [NFR licences](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/resellers/#nfr-programpolicy).

These examples are not exhaustive. If in doubt, ask questions about the
situation under which the ticket is being raised.
