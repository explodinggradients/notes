## Overview

The Support Liaison role is aimed at building and maintaining a good
relationship with another (non-product) team's representative in order to learn
about each other's teams and how they work, and then to develop processes and
documentation to allow the two teams to work together easily and effectively on
an ongoing basis.

## Current Support Liaison Roles and Assignments
<!-- I'm suggesting that for liaisons we do not specify a liaison and a manager, just a liaison. So
     I've removed the managers from the table. Most of the roles had only a manager listed, and for
     those I've made the manager the liaison. Verify with the managers about the removal. The list is:
     UX/UX : Lyle
     UX/Docs : Tom A
     Production : Lyle
     Security : Lyle
     Sales/Community : Tom A
     -->

*If you're missing from this list (and want to be on it) please let the Support
Managers know in `#spt_managers`.*

## Detailed Descriptions of Specific Support Liaison Roles

### Open Source Support Liaison

The Open Source Support Liaison (OSS Liaison) assists [GitLab's Open Source
Partners](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/open-source/partners/) with technical questions, problems, and needs.

The OSS Liaison has three primary duties:

1. building rapport,
1. providing assistance, and
1. making connections

OSS Liaisons sit in on meetings and attend Q&A sessions with open source
partners to build rapport, address technical questions, and nurture a thriving
relationship. When members of the [Open Source Partners program](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/open-source/partners/) are in need of technical support or
assistance with GitLab, an OSS Liaison serves as a point of contact on the
Support team. As a point of contact, OSS Liaisons assist with basic technical
support questions or escalate internally and find others to assist with more
complicated technical problems. OSS Liaisons also subscribe to notifications
on issues created by partners and help by getting other team members or teams
involved in finding solutions.

Familiarity with open source concepts, licenses, and communities is recommended.

If you're on the Support Team and would like to be an Open Source Support
Liaison, post in `#spt_managers` and reach out to GitLab's Open Source Program
Manager (`@bbehr`).
