## Role

Product Analysts at GitLab are curious, highly strategic, and focused on making GitLab better
through trusted data insights. Working with product teams, they look at customer behaviors
across the customer journey and help make improvements to the customer experience and
business outcomes.

As a member of the Product Data Insights team, the successful candidate will develop BI
solutions to understand product usage and customer activity, create and own multiple Product
Key Performance Indicators, develop a deep understanding of product health and the customer
experience, advance data acumen across the company, and promote strategic decisions through
data storytelling.

We work in a very unique way at GitLab, where flexibility and independence meet
a high paced, pragmatic way of working. And everything we do is [in the open](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/).

We recommend looking at our [about page](https://about.gitlab.com/company/) and at the
[Product Data Insights handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-analysis) to get started.
