title: "Chief of Staff to the CEO"
---

The Chief of Staff to the CEO is a very talented individual who serves as a trusted advisor and confidant to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) for up to 36 months. The Chief of Staff to the CEO and the CEO work closely together to get twice as much done as the CEO would be able to do alone. Over time the work will get more interesting culminating in a senior leadership position at GitLab or another company. This is a unique opportunity to see every aspect of a fast-growing unicorn at the CEO level. For more context see the [references](#references) at the end of this page.

This is a senior leadership role. This role does not do any work our [Executive Business Administrators](/job-families/people-group/executive-business-administrator/) (EBAs) are already doing, who for example, are responsible for scheduling and driving the [Objective and Key Results](https://about.gitlab.com/company/okrs/) (OKR) process. This role could have EBA support, although will not have a dedicated EBA themselves. It also is unrelated to the work of our [CEO Shadow training program](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/shadow/) who, for example, takes notes during all meetings with the CEO. A detailed list of the types of projects the Chief of Staff to the CEO might work on can be found in the Chief of Staff to the CEO [handbook page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/chief-of-staff-team/#what-projects-does-the-cost-work-on).

## Job Grade

The Chief of Staff to the CEO is a [grade 12](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-calculator/#gitlab-job-grades).
