Specific responsibilities per role are outlined below

#### SMB First Order Account Executive

As an SMB First Order Account Executive, you will be one of the first interactions a future customer has with GitLab. Your ability to successfully help them evaluate our product for their need and clearly define their buying process is critical to ensuring a good first experience with GitLab, which typically leads to higher customer retention and continued growth.

#### SMB Pooled Account Executive

As an SMB Pooled Account Executive, you will work closely with our top Pooled customers renewing their subscription with GitLab to ensure they have a successful renewal as well as helping them evaluate any additional product evaluations that they need. Responsibilities within our top Pooled customers include engaging with customers prior to their renewal, evaluating their current utilization of GitLab and making recommendations to ensure a successful renewal and continued adoption of GitLab based on their needs.  The SMB Pooled Account Executive will also be responsible for supporting our entire Pooled customer base on an as-needed basis, partnering closely with the Self-Service team.

Your ability to support them to successfully implement their recent purchase, helping them get answers to product related questions as well as understand their immediate and longer term company goals is critical to ensuring their experience with GitLab is successful and will lead to a successful renewal and/or expanded use of GitLab products and services.

As an SMB Named Account Executive you will be responsible for managing customers who have previously renewed with GitLab and expect to continue growing their adoption of our products and services to meet their business needs. You will need to be able to build out intricate customer success plans and have a good understanding of our customers business needs and what GitLab products can support them at each stage of their business lifecycle.

## SMB Operations

**Renewal/account intake:**

Renewal/account intake involves responding to customers that contact GitLab through the following channels:

1. Salesforce Cases
1. Zendesk
1. Direct email (customers, partners)

The instructions below describe the basic process for properly handling inquiries from each of these channels.

**Salesforce Cases** (proactively monitor, check at least three times daily):

- Navigate to the "Cases" tab in [Salesforce](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/).
- Create custom view for managing all cases assigned to your alias specifically. (Instructions for creating new view coming soon.)
- Review [this view](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/500?fcf=00B61000004LtSU) of unassigned cases and reassign to yourself any within your [territory](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/).
- Navigate to your cases view in SFDC, filter for most recent cases. With any open cases, please work according to the following steps:
  - Open case > Open account.
  - If the account has an owner that is not you or is Sales Admin and not within your territory, navigate back to case, reassign it to the proper account owner based on territory, and chatter them.
  - If the account is owned by you or Sales Admin and is within your territory, check for activity history on the case, account, and contact.
  - If a colleague has responded to the case or is in touch with the contact, reassign the case to them.
  - If there is no activity history, respond to case and continue communication with customer via email.
  - After responding, update case status from "New" to "Closed". This ensures only untouched cases will remain in your queue.

**Zendesk** (proactively monitor, check at least three times daily):

- Navigate to [Zendesk](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/).
- Click "Views" and choose "Upgrades, Renewals & AR (refunds)".
  - Tickets are automatically sorted from greatest urgency to least, start from tickets at the top of the list.
  - Open ticket, then review the activity log. If a sales colleague has already been in touch and this customer is awaiting another reply, ping your colleague on Slack with a link to this ticket if an SLA breach is imminent.
  - If there is no activity history on the ticket, use the contact's email address from Zendesk and check SFDC to see who ticket should be routed to.
  - When the account is in your territory, reassign the ticket to yourself (if not already in your name), and respond and/or update the ticket status accordingly.

Ticket status can be updated in the following ways:

- "*Submit as Pending*" if you have written a response to a prospect and are expecting their response.
- "*Submit as Solved*" if the ticket has been resolved and can be closed (i.e. no response is expected from the prospect).
- "*Submit as Open*" if the account is outside of SMB segmentation; make sure to cc the appropriate account owner within the ticket. Ping the account manager on Slack notifying them of the active ticket that requires their response.
  - If the account is requesting a refund or billing support, disposition the ticket to the Accounts/Receivable Refunds form on the left panel and "*Submit as Open*".

-*Direct email** (proactively monitor, check at least three times daily):

- If a Customer or Partner emails you directly, check SFDC for account ownership and introduce the correct colleague.
- If the account is in your territory, continue correspondence via email.

### Pitch and Negotiation

#### Pitch

**Here are some basic resources for pitching Gitlab and our different product offerings:**

- [GitLab product messaging](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/)
- [GitLab product tiers](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/)
- [Tier Messaging](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/)
- [Product Feature Comparison](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/feature-comparison/)
- [Product Pricing](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/)
- [DevOps Tools Landscape](https://about.gitlab.com/competition/)

**Pitching GitLab on the SMB team:**

Normally we do not use a “pitch deck” given the nature of why SMB customers are coming to us at this time. The vast majority of customers that are wanting to speak with us have already done their research on GitLab and are familiar with the product. Therefore, it is not currently necessary to present company details and product vision at the SMB level for the bulk of our customer conversations. It is our job to validate their decision to go with GitLab and create as much value as possible.

The “pitch” is mainly dependent on listening to the customers needs and figuring out which product is right for them.

Use discovery to help build a story and collect relevant information in order to map out the features and value to focus on

- Which tools are they looking to replace with GitLab?
- What is their primary driver for looking at GitLab in the first place?
- A little bit on [Creating Value](https://about.gitlab.com/company/pricing/#value-creation)
- Size and Scope
  - Scope- Find out how many components of GitLab they want to use
  - Size- The larger the organization, the more value GitLab provides

- A single application sets up a small or medium sized business for a scalable situation as their organization grows

- After the initial round of questioning, summarize your findings to the customer and prescribe how GitLab can solve their problem and what product tier they require
  - Are they interested in Epics? Yes → Ultimate
  - Do they have a need for security? Yes → Ultimate

**Pitching for the upgrade:**

When dealing with a potential upgrade, it is again important to listen to the customers needs. If no need to upgrade currently exists, it is possible to uncover one.

**Drivers for each product edition:**

Below are some common drivers the SMB team has seen for a customer to gravitate towards a certain product edition. It is important to be aware of these drivers when determining and suggesting the right product tier for both new and current customers.

- To Premium
    1. All of the developer features
        - Maven Repository - [more info](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/maven_repository/index.html)
        - Security Features
            - Merge request approvals - [more info](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2015/07/29/feature-highlight-merge-request-approvals/)
            - Protected Environments - [more info](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2018/09/22/gitlab-11-3-released/#protected-environments)
    1. Occasionally they are looking for more advanced project management features
        - CI/CD for external repositories
            - May have their repository in BitBucket or GitHub and need to upgrade in order to support that
            - [GitLab CI for GitHub](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/github/)
    1. Additional CI/CD minutes (Silver only)
        - This decreased when we saw CI minutes on demand get introduced - [more info here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/settings/continuous_integration.html#extra-shared-runners-pipeline-minutes-quota)
- To Ultimate
    1. Need to provide the value of a single application for their SDLC (SCM, CI, Project Management, Security)
        - Reduces tool chain cost and friction
    1. Project Management
        - Direct competition with Jira
    1. Security
        - Determine the importance of security
            - More regulated industries tend to be more interested in Ultimate because of their security needs
    1. [Why Ultimate?](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TP5cXH5Nr0VkH7mE6M_-DFXT_Jnq7o5LPxuMUz2paI4/edit#slide=id.g2ee90b3719_0_0)

### Negotiation

**Some resources for negotiation:**

- [Our Pricing Model](https://about.gitlab.com/company/pricing/)
- [Common Negotiation Mistakes](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/training/)
- [Pricing Approval Matrix](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-8TG8YLAQB-465mFLYnX3wkB6C6-0aI1A4CzdfjpacU/edit?pli=1)
- [Handling Price Objections](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/training/)
- [More on Price Objections](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/training/)
- [Process for Agreement Terms Negotiations](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/order-processing/#process-for-agreement-terms-negotiations-when-applicable)

1. Premium edition - we typically do not negotiate, but we can sometimes make exceptions in special cases such as multi-year agreements and high volume deals
    - By default, we do not offer any discounts
        - If they are unhappy with that, bring up the idea of multi-year pricing
            - Multi-year pricing can be especially helpful if the company plans on adding more users in the following year
    - Bring up the idea of discussing Ultimate
1. Ultimate
    - For customers who are coming up on renewal and are on early adopter pricing, there is an increase to our current Ultimate price
        - In these cases, refer to the pricing approval matrix to reference how you can assist them
    - Always bring up multi-year deals and more users added in advance
    - It’s important to identify the customer’s needs around Ultimate to see how they will be using it. This is why proving the value of Ultimate prior to negotiating is crucial.
