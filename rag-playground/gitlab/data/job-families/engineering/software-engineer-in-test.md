Software Engineers in Test at GitLab help grow our test automation efforts across the entire GitLab ecosystem.
As a Software Engineer in Test, you'll work in a key position, where your efforts will have a noticeable impact on both the company and product.
In addition to the requirements below, successful candidates and team members will share a passion for high-quality software,
strong engineering principles, and methodical problem-solving skills.

## Responsibilities

- Expand our existing test automation framework and test coverage.
- Develop new tests and tools for our GitLab.com frontend, backend APIs and services, and low-level systems like geo-replication,
CI/CD, and load balancing.
- Have the ability to grow your knowledge of GitLab provisioning and setup tools like Terraform and Ansible.
- Setup and maintain new GitLab test environments.
- You’ll work on test automation issues related to the Quality department, the [stage group you're embedded in](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#devops-stages), and the entire GitLab product. The work you’ll do will be [transparent and open to the GitLab community](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=Quality)
- Participate in test pipeline triage rotation and ensure pipeline failures are triaged promptly.
- Develop working knowledge of the entire GitLab application stack including tests at all levels. (Unit, Integration, and End-to-end).
- Groom and prune GitLab tests at all levels to ensure optimal coverage and effective deduplication.
- Collaborate with a [Product Manager and with the wider product and development team](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/#build-track) to understand how new features should be tested and to contribute to automated tests for these new features.
- Collaborate with engineers to define and implement mechanisms to inject testing earlier into the software development process.
- Identify, share, and nurture the adoption of best practices in code health, testing, testability, and maintainability in collaboration with the wider Quality department. You should champion clean code and the concept of the test pyramid.
- Analyze complex software systems and collaborate with others to improve the overall design, testability, and quality.
- Strive for the fastest feedback possible. Test parallelization should be a top priority.
You see distributed systems as a core challenge of good test automation infrastructure.
- Configure automated tests to execute reliably and efficiently in CI/CD environments.
- Track and communicate test results in a timely, effective, and automated manner.
