## Hiring Process

Candidates for this position can expect the hiring process to follow the order below. Please keep in mind that candidates can be declined from the position at any stage of the process. To learn more about someone who may be conducting the interview, find their job title on our [team page](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/).

- Selected candidates will be invited to schedule a 30-min [screening call](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/interviewing/#screening-call) with one of our Global Recruiters or the Hiring Manager. In this call we will discuss your experience, understand what you are looking for in a UX Research role, discuss your compensation expectations, reasons why you want to join GitLab and answer any questions you have.

- The next step will be a 30-min meeting to cover some scenario-based questions where will look to understand how you handle common situations that UX Researchers find.

- After that, we'll invite you to record a case study walkthrough video. The recording is expected to be **20-minutes in duration** and returned **within ten days** of the screening call. In addition to the details below, [this discussion on our GitLab Unfiltered YouTube playlist](https://youtu.be/VU2BKjGoer4) provides an overview of what we're looking for.

> ### Why we ask for a pre-recorded presentation
>
> 1. It helps create a shared understanding of your work between you and our interviewers ahead of the first interview.
> 1. It allows us to ask more informed questions about your experience and work during the interview process.
> 1. Generally, we [avoid using meetings as a means to present](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#common-meeting-problems). Instead, we record presentations, upload to our Unfiltered Youtube channel, and use a meeting as a Q&A. This interview exercise provides you with an opportunity to experience this style of work.
>
> ### Presentation Topics
>
> 1. An introduction: who you are, where you're based, your background, and why you're a UX Researcher.
> 1. An overview of one *or* two research studies. We want to understand: why you chose to present this case study, the size, discipline make-up, and structure of the team you were a part of; the goals of the project; how you approached research; what you personally did on the project, how you synthesized research data to inform product and design decisions; the final output of your research; the challenges you faced throughout the project; and the meaningful business impact that the research resulted in.
>
> ### What we're looking for
>
> - A recording that is up to 20 minutes in duration and returned to us within ten days of your screening call being completed.
> - Ideally, one case study you present should be relevant to the work you'd expect do at GitLab. This could be because the case study involved research into the [persona(s)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/personas/#user-personas) you'd study at GitLab, the case study related to the DevOps or Developer tooling industry, the case study relates to the [Stage](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#devops-stages) you're interviewing for, is a case study that went across multiple methods, or was a case study that would be considered complex in nature. Note that at GitLab, UX Researchers at any level are working on [problem validation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/problem-validation-and-methods/), [foundational](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/ux-research/foundational-research/) or [strategic](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/ux-research/strategic-research-at-gitlab/) research projects, while Product Designers conduct solution validation. We'd like to see a case study that is of problem validation, foundational, or strategic nature.
> - You share the recording using either a [unlisted Youtube link](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/157177?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en), a [Google Drive link](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2494822?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en), or a [Loom link](https://www.loom.com/).
> - Your presentation to address each of the topics listed above.
>

> - We work with a [low level of shame](/handbook/values/#low-level-of-shame) at GitLab. In this context, this means we don't expect your presentation to be highly polished.
> - Other questions? Want the Recruiter to review your presentation before the review from the Hiring Manager? Don't hesitate to get in touch with the Recruiter who conducted your screening call.

- We will schedule the next stages if the recording indicates your past experiences will lead to your success in a role at GitLab.

- Candidates will be invited to a 50-minute interview with a UX Researcher. Overall, this interview aims to understand how you choose your research methods, how you present results, how you work with a wider team of counterparts, and how you determine whether your research resulted in a meaningful business impact. This interview will also look to understand the softer skills you have as a researcher and how you apply those in the real world.

- The next interview is a 50-minute interview with either a Product Design Manager, Product Designer or Product Manager. In this interview, we'll focus on how you collaborate with cross-functional stakeholders and mentor non-researchers in successfully conducting research. This interview is an opportunity for you to understand the stage you will be a part of in more detail, hear a different perspective on the stable counterpart relationship, and ask any questions you have.

- Candidates will the be invited to a 50-minute interview with a UX Research Manager where we'll focus on your experience researching Developers and working with global team members in an Agile setting.

- The final interview is a 1-hour interview with the Director of UX Research. You will discuss your career, your experiences as a UX Researcher, and the role of UX Research at GitLab.

- Successful candidates will subsequently be made an offer via Zoom.
