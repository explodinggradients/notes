## Career Ladder

There is no set career path for a Chief of Staff. As such, the role is often viewed as having a ~2 year rotation — a passthrough program with an eye towards leading a functional area of their business thereafter. Some may step into a senior leadership role in operations or strategy, or some may continue to grow thier career and thrive in the CoS role for a longer time period. It is more common to see a CoS evolve into functional leadership roles — roles that require management experience, strong communication and contextual knowledge of multiple teams working together.
