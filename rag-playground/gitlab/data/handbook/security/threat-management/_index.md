## Security Threat Management Sub-Department

The Security Threat Management sub-department is responsible for identifying and remediating vulnerabilities or threats that may impact GitLab, our Team Members or our Customers and the community at large.

- conducting in-depth security related research and assessments
- transparently communicating important information externally to customers and the community alike
