## <i class="fas fa-bullseye" style="color:rgb(110,73,203)" aria-hidden="true"></i> Security Governance Mission

The 'G' in [GRC](https://www.oceg.org/about/what-is-grc/), GitLab's security governance discipline helps to define, train and measure security strategies and progress toward security objectives by creating a set of processes and practices that run across departments and functions. By following a Governance framework, GitLab ensures accountability, fairness and transparency in both how the company runs and how it communicates with its stakeholders.

## <i class="far fa-lightbulb" style="color:rgb(110,73,203)" aria-hidden="true"></i> Core Competencies

These are the core responsibilities of the security governance discipline.

### Security Assurance metrics

Measuring performance effectiveness of our security controls, against a plan to prevent security incidents and safeguard sensitive data to improve the security posture of GitLab and the reduction of risk. "If you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it" -Lord Kevin.

### Regulatory and compliance landscape monitoring

To support GitLab's regulatory and compliance requirements, the Security Governance team conducts **quarterly** monitoring for changes to such requirements. Material changes are reported to relevant team members for triage and action.

### GCF Control Maintenance

Managing the [GCF control framework]({{< ref "sec-controls" >}}), to include changes as a result of the risks and regulatory requirements.

### Security Compliance Training

Creating and managing [security compliance trainings]({{< ref "sec-training" >}}) to ensure GitLab team members are aware and trained in security core competencies.

### GRC Application Administration

Managing a [variety of tools]({{< ref "security-assurance#core-tools-and-systems-1" >}}) used by the Security Assurance Team carrying out defined administrative tasks such as

- Configuration changes
- User Access Management
- Upgrades/patching/incidents/restores
- High-Level quality oversight
- etc.

We will assist in managing and providing guidance to carry out day to day activities related to the core competencies of all [compliance activities within ZenGRC]({{< ref "zg-activities" >}}) such as Control Testing, UARs, Vendor Reviews and Risk Assessments to automate, integrate and streamline business processes to increase GitLab's Information Security Program maturity and deliver measurable ROI.
