## Where we work

We primarily work out of the [Team-Commercial Compliance group project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-assurance/team-commercial-compliance). This group includes subgroups and projects for:

- Team information and directory
- External Certifications
- User Access Review Program
- Audit Reports (output of CCM efforts)
- Gap Analysis Program
- ISCP and BCP tests and final reports
- IT General Control Support (ITGC)

Work that overlaps with other teams including Dedicated Compliance can be found in the [Security Compliance - All Teams](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-assurance/security-compliance-commercial-and-dedicated) group. This group includes subgroups and projects for:

- GitLab Control Framework (GCF)
- Observation Management
- Security Compliance Intake (production readiness)
- Third Party Penetration Testing Program
- Exceptions

We also utilize external tooling including:

- ZenGRC: control testing and observations
- Authomize: User access review campaigns

## How we work

We strive for transparency whenever possible through the use of non confidential issues within our group projects and handbook documentation. However, not all of our work is externally visible. In order to continue striving for transparency, we are committed to delivering value to our external customers through community outreach efforts such as blogs, keeping the handbook up to date and providing documentation that demonstrates how we dogfood to meet our security compliance core compentencies.

We utilize GitLab Epics and Issue to track projects, deliverables and milestones. We are currently working on upleveing our internal metrics and reporting through the use of insights charts, issue tasks and automation.
