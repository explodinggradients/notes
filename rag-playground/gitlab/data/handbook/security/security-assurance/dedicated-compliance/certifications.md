---

## Purpose

The Security Compliance (Dedicated Markets) team supports [GitLab Dedicated](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/), US public sector, and other regulated verticals. We are responsible for planning, obtaining, and maintaining industry-recognized security certifications for GitLab Dedicated SaaS offerings and self-managed GitLab to ensure customer trust. The benefits from these activities include:

For customers:

- increases visibility and confidence in our information security program and the Dedicated SaaS platform
- increases ease in onboarding and managing GitLab as a vendor

For GitLab:

- ensures we are meeting all requirements of a strong and comprehensive information security program aligned with industry best practices
- enables our field teams to quickly share the state of our security program with potential and existing customers
- reduces the need for GitLab's security team to fill out individual customer security questionnaires or assessments

## Scope

Generally, the scope of the items listed on this page include GitLab Dedicated, the GitLab Dedicated production environment, and global policies and procedures relied upon for control implementation.
