## GitLab offers Customer Assurance Packages tailored to customer needs

- **Community Package**: The first step on the trust journey, this package is a compilation of publicly available documentation designed to introduce GitLabâ€™s approach to security. Directly available from the [Customer Assurance Package page](https://about.gitlab.com/security/cap/). *All the documents in the Community Package are included in the Customer Packages*.
- **Customer Packages**: This package provides detailed security information to prospective and existing customers for completing vendor security assessments. Due to the sensitive nature of the documentation, an NDA is required to be in place prior to sharing the Customer Packages. Please review the [CAP request process](/handbook/security/security-assurance/field-security/customer-assurance-package.html#cap-request-process) for more details.

## How to request the CAP

Due to the nature of some of GitLab's security reports, the [Customer Package](https://about.gitlab.com/security/cap/) is available under a [Non Disclosure Agreement](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/NDA/) or contractual confidentiality  clauses only.

**Note**: Customers who have registered for services via GitLab.com and paid via credit card will be required to sign a purpose specific [NDA](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/NDA/) before the CAP can be distributed.

These resources can be requested by a GitLab team member on behalf of a customer/prospect using the **Customer Assurance workflow** in the [#sec-fieldsecurity](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CV5A53V70) slack channel or opening an issue directly in the [Customer Assurance Service Desk](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-assurance/field-security-team/customer-assurance-activities/caa-servicedesk).

Customers or prospects can request a copy using the `Request by Email` option on our [Customer Assurance Package](https://about.gitlab.com/security/cap/) webpage.

#### SME owned collateral

For collateral owned by SMEs outside of Field Security, we perform an annual review and maintenance session. SMEs are notified via a GitLab issue and assigned relevant collateral pieces for review and maintenance. Upon completion, the updated collateral pieces are added to the appropriate CAP and prepared for publishing.
