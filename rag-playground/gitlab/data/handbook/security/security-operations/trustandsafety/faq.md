### Security Testing

{{% details summary="Can I perform Security Testing on GitLab.com?" %}}
When researching security issues, especially those which may compromise the privacy of others, you must use only test accounts in order to respect our users’ privacy. Any attempt at accessing private information of other users, performing actions that may negatively affect GitLab’s users or disrupt GitLab operations will result in the account being blocked.

Security, or any, testing that could cause disruption on GitLab.com or be in violation of our Website Terms of use can be researched freely on your own installation of GitLab. GitLab is an open-core company, with the source code powering gitlab.com available at `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss` and `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab`. You are encouraged to install your own standalone instance for researching vulnerabilities. Screen captures, logs, and videos showing vulnerabilities against your own GitLab installation are encouraged.

Examples of disruptive activity include, but are not limited to:

1. Port scanning
1. Intrusion Attempts
1. Denial of Service Attack

When testing on GitLab.com, your `@wearehackerone.com` address must be associated with the testing gitlab.com user account. If separate accounts are necessary, you can use an alias. This will help us separate testing from other forms of abuse, and help inform the decision of blocking an account. Note that this does not provide immunity, and the [Rules of engagement](https://hackerone.com/gitlab?type=team) must be followed at all times.
