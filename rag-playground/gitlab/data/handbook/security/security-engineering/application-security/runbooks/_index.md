## Note for New team members

Whenever you are on a rotation ([HackerOne]({{< ref "hackerone-process" >}}) or [Triage Rotation]({{< ref "triage-rotation" >}}) or doing your onboarding process and need help or advice, reach out in the `#sec-appsec` Slack channel or ask during an AppSec Sync meeting. Here are some examples on scenarios where you may need ask or need help:

- You're doing your onboarding tasks, threat modeling, or appsec reviews, and you're stuck on it; or don't know how to tackle something in particular
- You're on ping rotation and you don't know how to deal with a particular situation or what to do with a specific question
- You're on HackerOne rotation and have to deal with a hard report
