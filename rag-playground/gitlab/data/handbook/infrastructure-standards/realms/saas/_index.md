The <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/">Engineering Infrastructure Environments handbook page</a> is the current SSOT for environments. As the WIP initiative to iterate on our company-wide infrastructure standards evolves, the Engineering Infrastructure pages will be refactored incrementally as the standards are documented, implemented, and changes to environments take place.
