## Overview

To order a YubiKey, open a Slack DM to yourself and use the /yubikey command.

When the prompt shows, fill in your information. There are some caveats here:

- Use a hyphen in cases of multiple surnames. (Sacha Baron Cohen would be Sacha Baron-Cohen, Hussain Al Jassmi would be Hussain Al-Jassmi) This helps during the parsing process and will help assure your order submits.
- Prefix your phone number with your international calling code. (+15551239999)
- Use your two letter state/region code for USA and Canada orders. (CA for California, QC for Quebec)
- If you need more address lines, please reach out in #it_security_help.

Select your YubiKey. For now, orders are limited to one YubiKey. You can use this prompt again for a replacement key if needed.

Once you have submitted the form, you will get a message from YubiBot. If you do not receive a confirmation message including your shipping reference number, please reach out in #it_security_help for assistance.
