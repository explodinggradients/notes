## Workflow change March 2019

As of March 2019, the Trust and safety Team has taken ownership of DMCA Requests.

Read more about the DMCA Workflow here: Abuse DMCA Request (TBD).

## Submitting a DMCA Request

All new `DMCA` requests can be sent to <dmca@gitlab.com> for review by Legal and Abuse.

The Abuse team will continue to maintain a single channel of communication with the requestor through the open `Abuse Issue` created when the request is received via <dmca@gitlab.com>.
