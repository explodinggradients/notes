### Overview

Our Emerging Talent strategy ignites GitLab to build toward creating globally inclusive access to opportunities so that everyone can contribute. Emerging Talent program participants, defined as talent with 2 years or less experience in a given domain, will be a value add as GitLab scales.

These programs aim to bridge the gap between education and experience by offering curriculum and work-integrated learning to talent at the Associate level, with no academic-based prerequisites.
.

### Goals

1. Establish Emerging Talent Acquisition Strategy within Engineering.
1. Build Emerging Talent Programs within Engineering.
    - FTE Rotation Program [Marketing Name = Associate Engineering Program aka AEP]
    - Internship Program [Marketing Name = Engineering Intership Program aka EIP]
