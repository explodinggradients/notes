title: Building High Performing Teams
---

## Introduction

One of the greatest challenges for leaders is to build and develop high performing teams. This page explores what it means to have a high performing team at GitLab. It will also explore a tactical roadmap called the Drexler-Sibbet Team Performance Model that managers can reference to build high performing teams.

## What Makes a High Performing Team at GitLab

Through various interviews with executive leadership and managers at GitLab, we have identified a series of skills, behaviors, and attributes of high performing teams at GitLab. Many of these points are in alignment with our values. To operate as a team in a remote environment, trust needs to be at the center of the formation of the team. Additional skills, behaviors, and attributes of high performing teams include:

- Handbook first approach
- Shared desire to grow others
- High Level of self-awareness
- Living our values
- Strong sense of ownership by individual team members
- Ego's are put into check
- Ability to see viewpoints from different perspectives
- Bias towards action
- Asynchronous communication practices
- Iteration, breaking down complex information into digestible parts
- Trust-based relationships where everyone is open to provide feedback

## Strategies to Improve Building High Performing Teams

The [Drexler-Sibbet Team Performance Model](https://www.kaizenko.com/drexler-sibbet-team-performance-model/) is an excellent tool to help build high performing teams at GitLab. The model provides a roadmap for a team and a common language. It is a simplified description of how a team works together that highlights the most important things the team needs to focus on to reach high performance. At GitLab, we can use it as a frame of reference to developing high performing teams. It can help Managers ensure new and existing team members know the mission and direction of the team by the following:

- To form your team
- To guide what your team does
- To monitor how well your team is doing
- To diagnose where your team may be struggling or identify the keys to your team's success

Let's explore the stages in more detail and strategies you can implement as a Manager in building a high performing team.

**7 Stages to developing high performing teams:**

1. **Orientation** - Why are we here? Team members need to see a sense of team identity and how individual team members fit in.
1. **Trust Building** - Who are you? Team members share mutual regard for each other and are open and supportive of trust-based relationships.
1. **Goal Clarification** - What are we doing? Assumptions are made clear; individual assumptions are made known with a clear vision of the end state.
1. **Commitment** - How will we do it? Team members understand how it will make decisions and do the work.
1. **Implementation** - Who does what, when, where? Team members have a sense of clarity and can operate effectively due to the alignment of shared goals.
1. **High-Performance** - Wow! The team is accomplishing more than it expected. The team has taken off, creativity is fostered and goals are surpassed.
1. **Renewal** - Why continue? The team is given recognition and celebrates achievements of individuals that produce valuable work. Reflect on lessons learned and reassess for the future.

### Stage 1 Orientation - Why am I here?

{{< youtube "zsDGaLH3LcE" >}}

Why am I here? Team needs to move from complete freedom to a set of “boundaries and constraints” that are needed to operate. The first step is to understand the purpose of the team.

- The first step of orientation is to understand the purpose of the team. Why does the team exist and what is expected of it?
- Team members need to see a sense of Team Identity in relation to the team.
- Membership has to do with understanding how you fit in on the team. New team members may be asking - “How can I make a difference on this team?”
- Unresolved orientation stage can include disorientation, uncertainty, and fear and can prevent trust-building.

**Questions that need to be answered in Stage 1:**

- Why does the team exist?
- What is expected of the team?
- Do I belong here?
- Is the work valuable and meaningful to me?
- How will my skill be used?
- How can I best contribute?

### Putting the Model Into Practice

You may be asking yourself:

> How do I apply the model on my team?

Great question! To assess how your team is doing, we've provided a couple of resources for you to leverage:

1. Check out the template: [High Performing Teams Diagnostic Tool](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1z-Zw5XgtAqfhnDvP9ce7EilJztB6PCObE3MDfIOij_k/edit)
1. Make a copy of the [template](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1z-Zw5XgtAqfhnDvP9ce7EilJztB6PCObE3MDfIOij_k/edit) for your own team and save in a secure folder.
1. Have each team member complete the survey individually over a course of a few days to assess your team's performance
1. Once the survey is complete, come together as a group and identify common areas where the team needs to address. Have each team member come with at least one idea on how the team can improve its performance. Managers can use the [Managers High Performing Teams Toolkit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tLmpibrOPDLX9smXWLPOzgQ38zGwnlGtbQjxYejPBRM/edit) to facilitate the conversation.
1. Discuss the ideas as a team and vote to identify at least one idea for implementation (e.g. process improvements, new tools, sync versus async collaboration, communication approaches, etc). Leverage the [team action plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EsfKfddU9Rk-OJ9qwZm4MTf7AAYMYahIALm8q3tkMTk/edit) for a future-focused discussion and plan of action for moving forward as a team.
1. Conduct a development discussion with each team member regularly during a 1:1 meeting. Inquire on the team members level of engagement. Ask them what else they would like to learn and explore how those development opportunities can be integrated into the role.

These are a few practices you can implement within your team to help all team members reach high performance!

### Motivating Others to Elicit Peak Performance

Another strategy to reach high performance is by applying [Maslow's hierarchy of needs as a motivational theory](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html) to elicit peak performance from team members. One of the most important tasks of a manager is to elicit peak performance. No matter how well a team is put together, the team will perform only as well as the team members on it. Managers can improve performance through training and/or motivation.

Maslow's theory of motivation: needs cause people to have drivers that result in motivation. To maintain a high degree of motivation, we must ensure our team members needs are met:

1. **Physiological:** basic needs such as food and shelter
1. **Security:** protection from losing basic needs (e.g. medical insurance)
1. **Social/Affiliation:** Inherent desire to belong to a common group, motivates us to join a company and show up for work
1. **Esteem/recognition:** Upward achievement and recognition
1. **Self-actualization:** The need to achieve one's personal best in a chosen endeavor; competence driven = job or task mastery; achievement-driven = need to achieve in all that they do.

Motivation has to come from a team member. But a manager can help motivation once self-actualization has been achieved. Self-actualization continues to motivate people to ever-higher levels of performance. A manager can create a result driven culture through motivation by living our values and emphasizing output.

### Summary

The Drexler-Sibbet Team Performance Model is an excellent tool to building and maintaining high performing teams at GitLab. As a Manager, use some of the tactical steps outlined on this page to ensure your team has a common understanding of the direction of the team. Your team will be on its way to building a high performing team!

## Live Learning Session

On 2021-01-11, we launched the second iteration of the Manager Challenge Program. During the Live Learning session and Async learning, Managers used the Building High Performing Teams model to plan how they will lead their team to high performance. We've posted the activity and roadmaps for you to leverage in helping your team reach high performance, and see what GitLab managers do within the teams they lead.

During Week 4 of our Manager Challenge Pilot, we had a course covering Building High Performing Teams. The [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qQelNkqtoFoaGgeMldzqCx5voOU4cpUBEBt-kSfjJ_o/edit?usp=sharing) and [meeting agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Ik6JxuRhldPWnIUGZrJiLc6dentI6_eE7QPABiXyvo/edit?usp=sharing) follow along with the session.

A recording of the second of two sessions can be found here:
