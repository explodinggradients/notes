# Table of Experiments

[Ragas](https://docs.ragas.io) is a tool that helps you measure different aspects of your RAG pipeline and make systematic improvements. This is something we wanted ourselves, so we built it.

Now that we have something to measure RAG pipelines, we are running more experiments on how you can improve them. This repository contains the code for these experiments.

Enjoy!
