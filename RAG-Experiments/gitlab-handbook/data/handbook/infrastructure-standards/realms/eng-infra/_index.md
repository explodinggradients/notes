## Overview

This realm is for the engineering infrastructure team to deploy shared and team-specific infrastructure resources that aren't appropriate for the `saas` realms.

Future Iteration with Engineering Infrastructure Handbook Pages

<div class="panel-body">
The <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/">Engineering Infrastructure Environments handbook page</a> is the current SSOT for environments. As the WIP initiative to iterate on our company-wide infrastructure standards evolves, the Engineering Infrastructure pages will be refactored incrementally as the standards are documented, implemented, and changes to environments take place.

## Realm labels and tags

The [global labels/tags](/handbook/infrastructure-standards/labels-tags) and [realm labels/tags](/handbook/infrastructure-standards/realms/eng-infra/labels-tags) should be applied to each resource.

## Realm Groups

Each infrastructure group has a shared GCP project and/or AWS account for group members.

If a group has not been implemented yet, please contact the realm owner for assistance. After a group is implemented, a separate handbook page is created with usage documentation.
