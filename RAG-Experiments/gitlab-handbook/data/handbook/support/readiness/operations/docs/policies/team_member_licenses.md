## The process

The process for these is:

1. The GitLab team member files an access request (AR) using the
   [GitLab Team Member License request template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/issues/new?issuable_template=GitLab_Team_Member_License_request).
1. GitLab team member pings Support Ops.
1. Support Operations logs into the staging
   [staging cDot app](https://customers.staging.gitlab.com/admin/license/new_license)
   and generates the license using the parameters in the AR.
1. Support Operations updates the AR and closes it out.

#### Creating a license

**Note** Before proceeding, please confirm the requested end date on the issue
does not exceed 1 year. If it does, we cannot proceed with the request until
the requester changes that.
