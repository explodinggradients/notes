title: "Biggest Tailwinds"
---

We believe that the market opportunity for a complete DevSecOps platform designed as a single application for the software development lifecycle is [several billion dollars and expanding](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/tam/#:~:text=Total%20Addressable%20Market%20(TAMkt)%20is,revenue%20per%20user%20(ARPU).&text=Additional%20potential%20users%3A,Product%20managers). There are three primary trends outlined below that we have identified as the most significant to supporting the long term success of our business.
We also have a [Mitigating Concerns page]({{< ref "mitigating-concerns" >}}).

## 4. All-Remote

[All-Remote](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/)

GitLab's all-remote workforce is significantly more advanced and sophisticated than other forms of organizational design. Our dedication to working [handbook-first](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first-documentation/), operating [transparently]({{< ref "values#transparency" >}}), and [usage of GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/gitlab-for-remote/) to drive results creates tailwinds for the organization.

GitLab's adherence to all-remote makes the company an attractive destination for people who are on the [B-team in hybrid-remote firms](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/hybrid-remote/#all-remote-upgrade), or feel limited by the inflexibility of a fully colocated role.
