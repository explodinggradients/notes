Firstly, by keeping in touch with various industry leaders, the CEO is able to learn from and know senior leaders within the industry. This provides them with a broader understanding of what success looks like in other companies and what challenges they may face. This knowledge can then be applied to GitLab's current challenges and opportunities.

Additionally, by asking questions about how these industry leaders would approach GitLab's challenges or opportunities, the CEO gains valuable insights and perspectives that can inform their decision-making and problem-solving. This allows them to set better targets and ask better questions when working with functional leaders.

Furthermore, the CEO's engagement with industry leaders from underrepresented groups prioritizes learning from individuals with different backgrounds. This diversity of perspectives can lead to more innovative and inclusive solutions, as well as a better understanding of the needs and experiences of underrepresented groups. By incorporating these insights into their interactions with functional leaders, the CEO can be a more effective partner and advocate for diversity and inclusion within the organization.",reasoning,True
