## Director, Developer Relations

At other companies the role would likely be called director of Developer Relations (DevRel).
Since developers are also our users we call it Developer Relations.
And instead of giving talks and writing blogs ourselves our team focusses on enabling our community members.

As the Director, Developer Relations, you will be responsible for managing and building a team and stellar strategy focused on supporting evangelists, committers, students, and open source projects.
