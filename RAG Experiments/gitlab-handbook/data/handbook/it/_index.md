title: "IT Self Service"
description: "The IT Self Service handbook page provides all of our team members easy access to all of the processes and solutions for IT related services."
---

This IT Self Service handbook page provides all of our team members with a SSOT knowledge base directory of all the processes and solutions related to IT whether you've just started at GitLab or have been here awhile.

We have several teams at GitLab that focus on specific functions typically handled by an IT organization. Our Tech Stack applications have a wide range of [System Owners](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/#cross-department-system-owners) across the organization that may not be managed day-to-day by the Information Technology department outside of a security and compliance function.

Our handbook is organized per function and result, so the goal of this page is to provide cross-links to other handbook pages and sections that have the answers you're looking for, even if it's on a different department's handbook page. Please contribute any crosslinks if we missed anything.

## Helpdesk

If you can't find what you're looking for in the handbook, please ask in the `#it_help` Slack channel. If you do not have access to Slack (rare), please email `it-help@gitlab.com`.

We have IT Analysts available 24x5 to assist or fix anything you need related to your laptop, applications you use, or credentials used to sign in. You can see all of the applications that we manage in the [IT Tech Stack](#it-tech-stack) below. We escalate to IT Systems Engineers, IT Security, or other team members as needed.

> Our team uses an on-call schedule so please ask in the Slack channel instead of contacting a team member via Slack DM directly.

**Product Related:** For general GitLab or product questions, ask in `#questions`. For performance, outage, or UI bugs or breaking changes with GitLab.com (SaaS), please ask in `#is-this-known`.  You can check the `#production` channel for active incidents related to the GitLab.com service.

**Security Related:** If you have a broader question about security topics that is not blocking you from doing your work, feel free to ask in the `#security` channel where security team members can help answer.

**Emergency Lost Device:** If you lose any device that contains your credentials or GitLab data (laptop, phone, tablet, YubiKey, thumb drive, etc.), report it using `/security` in Slack to engage the [SIRT on-call engineer](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/security-operations/sirt/engaging-security-on-call.html#engage-the-security-engineer-on-call). They will take immediate action to deactivate or wipe compromised devices and/or credentials. If you do not have Slack accessible, you can email `panic@gitlab.com` from your work email address or personal email address (that is on file in Workday).

**Emergency Personal Situation:** If you need emergency support from the GitLab People (HR) Team, please follow the [handbook instructions](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/#in-case-of-emergency).

- ðŸ‘€ [Home Office Equipment and Supplies Reimbursement Policy (Monitors and Peripherals)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/procurement/office-equipment-supplies/)

When you leave GitLab, home office equipment and supplies under $1,000 USD per item don't need to get returned and are okay for you to keep. Any reimbursed expenses greater than $1,000 USD per item (or over) is classed as company property and you will be required to return the item(s).

In most cases, this means that you get to keep your monitor(s), keyboard, mouse, headphones, webcam, standing desk, etc. See the Laptop Decommission and Return Policy to learn more about your laptop.

## Tech Stack

The Tech Stack is a list of all the technology that GitLab currently uses to support the business.

Historically, the Tech Stack was a YAML file with a list systems/applications/tools used by all departments and details the business purpose/description, the owners, the provisioners, the teams that access the tool and other details. This is still the SSOT for a directory of applications.

- [Overview](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/tech-stack)
- [SSOT YAML](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/tech_stack.yml)

- [Change Management](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/change-management/)
- [IT Engineering Issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/engineering/operations/issue-tracker/-/issues)

As we continue to iterate, we are creating public handbook pages with user guides (below), internal handbook pages with admin guides, and link architecture and security documentation/issues/reviews from the admin guide.
