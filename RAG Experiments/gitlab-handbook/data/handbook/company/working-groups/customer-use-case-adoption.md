## Purpose

This working group is charged with driving the necessary cross-functional alignment, prioritization, and execution required to deliver improved customer adoption of key use cases within the GitLab platform. Following the 2023-05-16 Sales Key Review, there was a high-priority focus on driving customer use case adoption as the north star KPI and #1 predictor of Churn & Contraction. The formation of this working group was a direct outcome to accelerate efforts to win against GitHub and reduce Churn & Contraction.

**Desired Outcomes**

1. Drive **cross-functional alignment** around use case adoption across sales, customer success, product, data, finance, etc.
1. Mature **existing and new use cases and measures**, including thresholds
1. Build use cases as input into **actions** to drive the business

### FY24 Refocusing of Working Group on CI Adoption

Effective 2023-08-17, the focus of the Customer Use Case Adoption working group pivoted explicitly to CI Adoption and driving the cross-functional workstreams required to achieve CI Adoption ARR of 50% by the end of FY24-Q3. Given the workstreams aligned upon, the expectation is that CI will be the only Use Case focused on by this working group for the remainder of FY24.

## Exit criteria
