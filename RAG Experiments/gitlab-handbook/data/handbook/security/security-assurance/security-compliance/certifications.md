## Purpose

In support of our ongoing commitment to information security and transparent operations, the GitLab Security Compliance teams are dedicated to obtaining and maintaining industry recognized security and privacy third party certifications and attestations. The benefits from these activities include:

For customers:

- increases visibility and confidence in our information security program
- increases ease in onboarding and managing GitLab as a vendor

For GitLab:

- ensures we are meeting all requirements of a strong and comprehensive information security program aligned with industry best practices
- enables our field teams to quickly share the state of our security program with potential and existing customers
- reduces the need for GitLab's security team to fill out individual customer security questionnaires or assessments

### Scope

## Requesting Evidence of Certifications or Attestations

GitLab's SOC3 report is publicly available and can be found within the `Community Package` on our [Customer Assurance Package webpage](https://about.gitlab.com/security/cap/). The nature of some of our other external testing is such that not all reports can be made publicly available. Not only do these reports contain very detailed information about how our systems operate (which could make a potential attack against GitLab easier) but these reports also contain proprietary information about how these audit firms conduct their testing. For these reasons we can only share certain documentation with prospective customers that are under an NDA with GitLab or with current customers bound by the confidentiality of our customer agreements. The reports should not be shared with anyone other than the individual requestor(s).

Current or Prospective customers may request these through their Account Manager, or by using the `Request by Email` option on the [Customer Assurance Package webpage](https://about.gitlab.com/security/cap/).

GitLab Team Members should follow the [Customer Assurance Activities]({{< ref "customer-security-assessment-process" >}}) workflow and use the option for "CAP Request".
