## What are Zendesk roles?

Zendesk uses Roles as a way to maintain permission sets for agents.

## How do we maintain them?

We currently maintain all groups via Zendesk itself.

## Creating a role in Zendesk

To create a group in Zendesk, you first need to go to the Admin Center
([Zendesk Global](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/admin/) /
[Zendesk US Federal](https://gitlab-federal-support.zendesk.com/admin/)). From
there, you need to go to the Groups page (People > Team > Roles).

From there, click the blue `Create role` button at the top-right of the page.
When making a role, you will:

1. Enter the name of the role
1. Enter a description of the role
1. Go through every permission option to determine the correct selections

After doing so, click the blue `Create role` button at the bottom-right of the
page.

## Editing a role in Zendesk

To edit a role in Zendesk, you first need to go to the Admin Center
([Zendesk Global](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/admin/) /
[Zendesk US Federal](https://gitlab-federal-support.zendesk.com/admin/)). From
there, you need to go to the Groups page (People > Team > Roles).

From there, locate the role in question and click the name. From here, you can
make the needed edits and click the blue `Save` button at the bottom-right of
the page.

## Deleting a group in Zendesk

To delete a group in Zendesk, you first need to go to the Admin Center
([Zendesk Global](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/admin/) /
[Zendesk US Federal](https://gitlab-federal-support.zendesk.com/admin/)). From
there, you need to go to the Groups page (People > Team > Groups).

From there, locate the role in question and hover over the name of the role.
Then click the 3 dots to the far-right side to open a submenu, which contains
the `Delete` option.

## Change management

As the role changes are unique in deployment, please see
[Zendesk role change management](/handbook/support/readiness/operations/docs/change_management#zendesk-role-change-management)
for more information.

#### Labels to use

For all issues and MRs involving roles, the label
`Support-Ops-Category::Orgs and Users` should be used.

#### Change criticality

Due to the nature and impact adding/editing/deleting Zendesk groups can impose
on agents, all issues/MRs related to Zendesk groups will be classified as either
[criticality 2](/handbook/support/readiness/operations/docs/change_criticalities#criticality-2)
or
[criticality 3](/handbook/support/readiness/operations/docs/change_criticalities#criticality-3)
