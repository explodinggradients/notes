How to deposit a cheque issued to an associate in my business into my business account?,"['Have the check reissued to the proper payee.'
 ""Just have the associate sign the back and then deposit it.  It's called a third party cheque and is perfectly legal.  I wouldn't be surprised if it has a longer hold period and, as always, you don't get the money if the cheque doesn't clear.

In that case you can have the associate go to the bank and endorse it in front of the teller with some ID.  You don't even technically have to be there.

Alternatively, the associate can deposit the cheque into their own account and write a cheque to your business.","To deposit a cheque issued to an associate in your business into your business account, you can follow these steps:

1. Endorse the cheque: Sign the back of the cheque with your business name as it appears on your business account.

2. Prepare a deposit slip: Fill out a deposit slip provided by your bank. Include the amount of the cheque, the account number, and any other required information.

3. Visit your bank: Go to your bank branch and present the cheque along with the completed deposit slip to a teller.

4. Provide identification: Show your identification, such as a driver's license or passport, to the teller.

5. Submit the cheque: Hand over the endorsed cheque and the deposit slip to the teller.

6. Verify details: Double-check with the teller to ensure all the information on the deposit slip is accurate.

7. Receive a receipt: Once the deposit is processed, the teller will provide you with a receipt. Keep this receipt for your records.

It's important to note that specific procedures may vary depending on your bank and location. It may be helpful to call your bank beforehand or check their website for any additional requirements or instructions.","To deposit a cheque issued to an associate in your business into your business account, you have a few options:

1. Have the associate sign the back of the cheque and deposit it into your business account. This is called a third-party cheque and is generally allowed. However, there may be a longer hold period for the funds, and if the cheque doesn't clear, you won't receive the money.

2.

 '""I have checked with Bank of America, and they say the ONLY way to cash (or deposit, or otherwise get access to the funds represented by a check made out to my business) is to open a business account.

 ""When a business asks me to make out a cheque to a person rather than the business name, I take that as a red flag. Frankly it usually means that the person doesn't want the money going through their business account for some reason - probably tax evasion. I'm not saying you are doing that, but it is a frequent issue. If the company makes the cheque out to a person they may run the risk of being party to fraud. Worse still they only have your word for it that you actually own the company, and aren't ripping off your employer by pocketing their payment. Even worse, when the company is audited and finds that cheque, the person who wrote it will have to justify and document why they made it out to you or risk being charged with embezzlement. It's very much in their interests to make the cheque out to the company they did business with. Given that, you should really have an account in the name of your business. It's going to make your life much simpler in the long run.""
 '""Like you said, it\'s important to keep your personal assets and company assets completely separate to maintain the liability protection of the LLC. I\'d recommend getting the business bank account right from the beginning. My wife formed an LLC last year (also as a pass-through sole proprietorship for tax purposes), and we were able to get a small business checking account from Savings Institute and Trust that has no fees (at least for the relatively low quantity of transactions we\'ll be doing). We wrote it a personal check for startup capital, and since then, the LLC has paid all of its own bills out of its checking account (with associated debit card). Getting the account opened took less than an hour of sitting at the bank.

Applying for and receiving business credit,"['""I\'m afraid the great myth of limited liability companies is that all such vehicles have instant access to credit.  Limited liability on a company with few physical assets to underwrite the loan, or with insufficient revenue, will usually mean that the owners (or others) will be asked to stand surety on any credit.

Factoring is a financial transaction   whereby a business sells its accounts   receivable (i.e., invoices) to a third   party (called a factor) at a discount   in exchange for immediate money with   which to finance continued business.   Factoring differs from a bank loan in   three main ways. First, the emphasis   is on the value of the receivables   (essentially a financial asset), not   the firm’s credit worthiness.   Secondly, factoring is not a loan – it   is the purchase of a financial asset   (the receivable). Finally, a bank loan   involves two parties whereas factoring   involves three. Recognise that this can be quite expensive.  Most banks catering to small businesses will offer some form of factoring service, or will know of services that offer it.  It isn\'t that different from cheque encashment services (pay-day services) where you offer a discount on future income for money now.

If the tax returns are not available, they may look at the personal returns of the owners. Additionally, collateral may be necessary and alternative funding options such as personal loans from family and friends could be considered.","Applying for and receiving business credit involves several steps. 

First, you need to gather all the necessary documents and information required by the credit provider. This typically includes your business registration details, financial statements, tax returns, bank statements, and any other relevant supporting documents.

Next, you can start researching and comparing different credit providers to find the one that best suits your business needs. Consider factors such as interest rates, credit limits, repayment terms, and any additional benefits or perks offered.

Once you have selected a credit provider, you can begin the application process. This usually involves completing an application form and submitting all the required documents. Some credit providers may also require a personal guarantee or collateral, depending on the size and type of credit you are applying for.

After submitting your application, the credit provider will review your information and assess your creditworthiness. They will evaluate factors such as your business's financial history, credit score, revenue, and industry risk. This process may take some time, and the credit provider may request additional information or clarification during the review.

If your application is approved, you will receive a credit offer outlining the terms and conditions of the credit agreement. Carefully review these terms before accepting the offer. Make sure you understand the interest rates, repayment schedule, fees, and any other obligations associated with the credit.

Once you have accepted the credit offer, the credit provider will typically set up an account for your business and provide you with the agreed-upon credit limit. You can then start using the credit as needed for your business expenses.

Remember to manage your business credit responsibly and make timely repayments to maintain a good credit history. This will help you build a positive credit profile and potentially increase your credit limit or access to other financial products in the future.","To apply for and receive business credit, it is recommended to follow these steps:

1. Set up a meeting with the bank that handles your business checking account. Go there in person and bring your business statements, including profit and loss, balance sheet, and a historical cash flow spreadsheet. This will help the banker understand your business and its needs.

2. Express your desire to establish credit and request a credit card account with a specific limit. Even if you can't get the desired limit initially, it's a good starting point.

3. Your banker might be able to help push your application through, even with a less-than-ideal credit history. Building a relationship with your banker is crucial for future credit needs.

4. If your business is newly formed and lacks sufficient tax returns, the bank may look at the personal tax returns and credit histories of the owners. Bringing in another partner may not necessarily help in this case.

5. Collateral may be required if your business has limited physical assets or insufficient revenue to underwrite the loan. Be prepared to offer collateral if necessary.

6. If traditional bank credit is not available, consider alternative funding options such as personal loans from family and friends. Making them partners in exchange for capital could be an option.

7. Factoring is another option to consider. Factoring involves selling your accounts receivable (invoices) to a third party at a discount in exchange for immediate financing. This can be an expensive option, but it focuses on the value of the receivables rather than the firm's creditworthiness.

8. Keep in mind that banks often offer better deals to new customers. If you have multiple bank accounts, you may miss out on switching bonuses and introductory rates. Consider consolidating your accounts to take advantage of these offers.

Remember to regularly meet with your banker, provide updated financial statements, and continue to build a relationship for future credit needs.","[""Set up a meeting with the bank that handles your business checking account.

Even if you can't get the limit you want, you'll be on your way and can meet again with your banker in 6 or 12 months. Once your credit is re-established you'll be able to shop around and apply for other rewards cards. One day you might want a line of credit or a business loan. Establishing a relationship with your banker ahead of time will make that process easier if and when the time comes. Continue to meet with him or her at least annually, and bring updated financial statements each time. If nothing else, this process will help you analyze your business, so the process itself is useful even if nothing comes of it immediately.""

401k Transfer After Business Closure,"[""You should probably consult an attorney. However, if the owner was a corporation/LLC and it has been officially dissolved, you can provide an evidence of that from your State's department of State/Corporations to show that their request is unfeasible. If the owner was a sole-proprietor, then that may be harder as you'll need to track the person down and have him close the plan.""]","If the owner of the business was a corporation or LLC that has been officially dissolved, you can provide evidence from your State's department of State/Corporations to show that their request to transfer the 401k is unfeasible. However, if the owner was a sole-proprietor, it may be more difficult as you will need to locate the person and have them close the plan.","If a business closes and you have a 401k with them, you have a few options for what you can do with your retirement funds. One option is to transfer the 401k to a new employer's retirement plan if you start working for a new company. This allows you to continue saving for retirement and keep your funds in a tax-advantaged account. 

If you do not start working for a new employer with a retirement plan, you can also choose to roll over your 401k into an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). This option gives you more control over your investment choices and allows your funds to continue growing tax-deferred. 

It is important to note that if you withdraw the funds from your 401k after the business closure, you may be subject to taxes and penalties. It is generally recommended to explore the transfer options mentioned above to avoid these extra costs. 

To make the transfer, you will need to contact your 401k provider and let them know about the business closure. They will guide you through the necessary steps and paperwork to transfer your funds to the new account of your choice.","If your previous employer's business has closed, it may impact the process of transferring your 401k funds. In such cases, it is important to contact the plan administrator or HR department of your previous employer to understand the options available to you. They will be able to provide guidance on how to proceed with the transfer and any necessary paperwork. It is also advisable to consult with a financial advisor or tax professional to ensure you make the most appropriate decision based on your individual circumstances.","[""The time horizon for your 401K/IRA is essentially the same, and it doesn't stop at the day you retire. On the day you do the rollover you will be transferring your funds into similar investments. S&P500 index to S&P 500 index; 20xx retirement date to 20xx retirement date; small cap to small cap... If your vested portion is worth X $'s when the funds are sold, that is the amount that will be transferred to the IRA  custodian or the custodian for the new employer. Use the transfer to make any rebalancing adjustments that you want to make. But with as much as a year before you leave the company if you need to rebalance now, then do that irrespective of your leaving. Cash is what is transferred, not the individual stock or mutual fund shares. Only move your funds into a money market account with your current 401K if that makes the most sense for your retirement plan. Also keep in mind unless the amount in the 401K is very small you don't have to do this on your last day of work. Even if you are putting the funds in a IRA wait until you have started with the new company and so can define all your buckets based on the options in the new company.""
 '""You can move money from a 403b to a 401k plan, but the question you should ask yourself is whether it is a wise decision. Unless there are specific reasons for wanting to invest in your new employer\'s 401k (e.g. you can buy your employer\'s stock at discounted rates within the 401k, and this is a good investment according to your friends, neighbors, and brothers-in-law), you would be much better off moving the 403b money into an IRA, where you have many more choices for investment and usually can manage to find investments with lower investment costs (e.g. mutual fund fees) than in a typical employer\'s 401k plan. On the other hand, 401k assets are better protected than IRA assets in case you are sued and a court finds you to be liable for damages; the plaintiff cannot come after the 401k assets if you cannot pay.  To answer the question of """"how?"""", you need to talk to the HR people at your current employer to make sure that they are willing to accept a roll-over from another tax-deferred plan (not all plans are agreeable to do this) and get any paperwork from them, especially making sure that you find out where the check is to be sent, and to whom it should be payable. Then, talk to your previous employer\'s HR people and tell them that you want to roll over your 403b money into the 401k plan of your new employer, fill out the paperwork, make sure they know to whom to cut the check to, and where it is to be sent etc. In my personal experience, I was sent the check payable to the custodian of my new (IRA) account, and I had to send it on to the custodian; my 403b people refused to send the check directly to the new custodian. The following January, you will receive a 1099-R form from your 403b plan showing the amount transferred to the new custodian, with hopefully the correct code letter indicating that the money was rolled over into another tax-deferred account.""'
 ""I would always suggest rolling over 401(k) plans to traditional IRAs when possible.  Particularly, assuming there is enough money in them that you can get a fee-free account at somewhere like Fidelity or Vanguard.  This is for a couple of reasons. First off, it opens up your investment choices significantly and can allow you significantly reduced expenses related to the account.  You may be able to find a superior offering from Vanguard or Fidelity to what your employer's 401(k) plan allows; typically they only allow a small selection of funds to choose from.  You also may be able to reduce the overhead fees, as many 401(k) plans charge you an administrative fee for being in the plan separate from the funds' costs. Second, it allows you to condense 401(k)s over time; each time you change employers, you can rollover your 401(k) to your regular IRA and not have to deal with a bunch of different accounts with different passwords and such.  Even if they're all at the same provider, odds are you will have to use separate accounts. Third, it avoids issues if your employer goes out of business.  While 401(k) plans are generally fully funded (particularly for former employers who you don't have match or vesting concerns with), it can be a pain sometimes when the plan is terminated to access your funds - they may be locked for months while the bankruptcy court works things out. Finally, employers sometimes make it expensive for you to stay in - particularly if you do have a very small amount.  Don't assume you're allowed to stay in the former employer's 401(k) plan fee-free; the plan will have specific instructions for what to do if you change employers, and it may include being required to leave the plan - or more often, it could increase the fees associated with the plan if you stay in.  Getting out sometimes will save you significantly, even with a low-cost plan.""
 ""I would check to see what the fee schedule is on your previous employer's 401k. Depending on how it was setup, the quarterly/annual maintenance fee may be lower/higher than your current employer. Another reason to rollover/not-rollover is that selection of funds available is better than the other plan. And of course always consider rolling over your old plan into a standard custodial rollover IRA where the management company gives you a selection of investment options.

Some items can be expensed; you get to deduct the entire cost in the first year but then if you don't stay in business, e.g. you get a job paying wages and are no longer self-employed, you have to recapture this and pay taxes on the amount recaptured in the later year.

 ""First of all, Dilip's answer explains well how the business deductions generally work. For most (big) expenses you depreciate it. However, in some cases you need to capitalize it, which is another accounting method. When you capitalize your expense, it becomes part of the basis of the product you're creating. Since you're an engineer, this might be relevant for you. Talk to your tax adviser. How exactly you deduct/depreciate/capitalize things, and what expense goes which way depends greatly on the laws and jurisdictions. Even in the US, different states have different laws, and the IRS and State laws don't have to conform (unfortunately). For example, the limitations on Sec. 179 deduction in 2010-2011 were 20 times higher on Federal level than in the State of California. This could have lead to cases where you fully deducted your expense on your Federal tax return, but need to continue and depreciate it on your State return (or vice versa). Good tax adviser is crucial to avoid or manage these cases.""
 'Keep this rather corny acronym in mind. Business expenses must be CORN: As other posters have already pointed out, certain expenses that are capital items (computers, furniture, etc.) must be depreciated over several years, but you have a certain amount of capital items that you can write off in the current tax year.']",The answer is not provided in the given context.,"When it comes to writing equipment purchases, such as computers, printers, and software, there are specific rules and guidelines for writing them off as business expenses in a home-based business. Here are the ins and outs:

1. Eligibility: To write off writing equipment purchases as business expenses, the items must be used exclusively for business purposes. If the equipment is used for personal reasons as well, only the percentage of its usage for business can be claimed.

2. Deductions: Writing equipment purchases can be deducted as a business expense in the year of purchase or depreciated over time. The IRS provides specific guidelines for depreciating different types of equipment, so it's important to familiarize yourself with those rules.

3. Home Office Deduction: If you have a dedicated space in your home used solely for business purposes, you may be eligible for the home office deduction. This allows you to deduct a portion of your home-related expenses, including a percentage of your writing equipment purchases, based on the square footage of your home office compared to the total area of your home.

4. Documentation: It's crucial to keep detailed records and receipts for all writing equipment purchases. This includes invoices, receipts, and any other supporting documents to substantiate the business use of the equipment. These records will be necessary in case of an audit or when filing your tax return.

5. Limits and Restrictions: There may be limits and restrictions on the amount you can deduct for writing equipment purchases, especially if they are considered capital expenses. The IRS sets limits on the maximum amount that can be deducted in a given tax year, so it's important to stay up-to-date with these regulations.

6. Consult a Tax Professional: Given the complexities and ever-changing tax laws, it's advisable to consult with a tax professional or accountant who specializes in small businesses or self-employment. They can provide personalized advice and ensure that you are maximizing your deductions while staying compliant with tax regulations.

Remember, the information provided here is a general overview, and tax laws can vary depending on your location. It's always best to consult with a professional to understand the specific rules and regulations that apply to your home-based business.","In a home-based business, you can generally write off the cost of equipment purchases as business expenses. However, there are a few things to consider:

1. Exclusive use: To qualify for the deduction, the equipment should be used exclusively for business purposes. If you also use it for personal use, you may only be able to deduct a portion of the cost.

2. Depreciation: Most equipment used in business needs to be depreciated over its useful life. This means you can deduct a portion of the cost each year based on IRS rules. However, there are some exceptions for smaller items that can be expensed in the first year.

3. Documentation: It's important to keep track of your equipment purchases and retain receipts or invoices as proof of the expense. This will be helpful in case of an audit.

4. Home office deduction: If you have a dedicated space in your home that is used exclusively for your business, you may also be eligible for a home office deduction. This can include a portion of your rent or mortgage, utilities, and other related expenses.

It's always a good idea to consult with an accountant or tax professional who can provide specific guidance based on your individual circumstances and the tax regulations in your country.","[""You would report it as business income on Schedule C.  You may be able to take deductions against that income as well (home office, your computer, an android device, any advertising or promotional expenses, etc.) but you'll want to consult an accountant about that.

 ""Costs for home / small business equipment under US$10,000 don't have to  be capitalized. They can be expensed (that is, claimed as an expense all in one year.)  Unless this printer is one of those behemoths that collates, folds, staples, and mails medium-sized booklets, it cost less than that. Keep track of your costs. Ask the charity to pay you those costs for the product you generate, and then donate that amount of money back to them. This will be good for the charity because they'll correctly account for the cost of printing.""
 ""Tax regulations vary from country to country - some permitting more deductions, some less - but here are a few guidelines. As regards the home-office: As regards the deductions: Think of it like this: in order to have space for a home-office you needed a bigger home.  That leads to increased rates, heating, insurance and so on.  Many tax regulators recognise that these are genuine expenses.  The alternative is to rent a separate office and incur greater expenses, leading to increased deductions and less overall tax paid (which won't finance the deficit). The usual test for deductions is: was the expense legitimately incurred in the pursuit of revenue?  The flexibility permitted will vary by tax authority but you can frequently deduct more than you expected.""]"

 ""They believe that it reduces the risk that Revenue Canada will deem you to be an employee and make them pay a whole pile of tax, EI, CPP and so on that should have been paid if you had been hired as an employee. It's my recollection that the employer gets dinged for both the employee and employer share of those withholdings (and generally the employer's share is larger than yours) so they really want to prevent it. There's a Revenue Canada publication about whether you're an employee or not. There's nothing on it about being incorporated, but still employers feel more protected when their contracts are incorporated.  We did work as a sole proprietorship at the very beginning, so that we could deduct our losses against employment income earned earlier in the year, before we started the business. You can find clients who will take you on. We incorporated once the losses were over with (basically we had bought the equipment and office supplies we needed to get started.) It's a simple and relatively inexpensive thing to do, and gives clients a sense of protection. It won't protect you from your own poor decisions since you'll be a director of the firm.""
 ""My understanding (I am not a lawyer or tax expert) is that you are not allowed to work for free, but you can pay yourself minimum wage for the hours worked.

If you are considering such a setup I would strongly advise you to hire a qualified small business accountant who will be familiar with the rules and will be able to advise you on what is and is not possible / sensible.

Intentions of Deductible Amount for Small Business,"['""If your sole proprietorship losses exceed all other sources of taxable income, then you have what\'s called a Net Operating Loss (NOL). You will have the option to """"carry back"""" and amend a return you filed in the last 2 years where you owed tax, or you can """"carry forward"""" the losses and decrease your taxes in a future year, up to 20 years in the future. For more information see the IRS links for NOL. Note: it\'s important to make sure you file the NOL correctly so I\'d advise speaking with an accountant. (Especially if the loss is greater than the cost of the accountant...)""']","The intentions of deducting the amount for a small business are to offset any losses incurred by the business against other sources of taxable income, resulting in a lower tax liability.","The deductible amount for small businesses serves several intentions. Firstly, it allows small businesses to manage their financial risks by providing a certain level of protection in the event of an unforeseen event or loss. By setting a deductible amount, small businesses can mitigate their insurance premiums and only claim for significant losses that exceed the deductible. This helps in reducing the overall cost of insurance coverage.

Secondly, the deductible amount encourages small businesses to implement risk management practices. By being responsible for a portion of the loss, businesses are incentivized to take measures to minimize risks and prevent potential losses. This can include investing in safety measures, implementing security systems, or conducting regular maintenance checks.

Additionally, the deductible amount helps in preventing small businesses from making frequent and minor claims. By having a deductible, businesses are more likely to only file claims for substantial losses, which can help prevent insurance fraud and reduce administrative costs for both the business and the insurance provider.

Overall, the intention of the deductible amount for small businesses is to strike a balance between providing financial protection and encouraging responsible risk management practices, while also reducing the overall cost of insurance coverage.","The intention of deductible amounts for small businesses is to provide tax benefits and incentives for business owners. By deducting certain expenses, such as health insurance premiums, transportation costs, and business-related expenses, small business owners can reduce their taxable income and potentially lower their overall tax liability. This can help alleviate some of the financial burden of running a business and encourage entrepreneurship. However, it is important to consult with a tax advisor or CPA to ensure that you are eligible for these deductions and to understand the specific rules and limitations that apply to your situation.","['""Short answer, yes. But this is not done through the deductions on Schedule A. This can happen if the employer creates a Flexible Spending Account (FSA) for its employees. This can be created for certain approved uses like medical and transportation expenses (a separate account for each category). You can contribute amounts within certain limits to these accounts (e.g. $255 a month for transportation), with pre-tax income, deduct the contributions, and then withdraw these funds to cover your transportation or medical expenses. They work like a (deductible) IRA, except that these are """"spending"""" and not """"retirement"""" accounts. Basically, the employer fulfills the role of """"IRA"""" (FSA, actually) trustee, and does the supporting paperwork.""'
 ""Unless the amounts involved are very small, it is MUCH better to incorporate. First, incorporation gives you limited liability for your acts as an employee. As an individual, you have unlimited liability. Second, incorporating allows you to deduct (for tax purposes) the costs of doing business, including all of your health insurance, most transportation, and some meals. The exception to the rule is if the amounts you are earning are so small that they don't cover the cost of incorporating, accounting fees, etc. (a few hundred, or at most a few thousand dollars).""
 ""While the OP disses the health insurance coverage offered through his wife's employer as a complete rip-off, one advantage of such coverage is that, if set up right (by the employer), the premiums can be paid for through pre-tax dollars instead of post-tax dollars. On the other hand,  Health insurance premiums cannot be deducted on Schedule C by self-employed persons. So the self-employed person has to pay both the employer's share as well as the employee's share of Social Security and Medicare taxes on that money. Health insurance premiums can be deducted on Line 29 of Form 1040 but only for those months during which the Schedule C filer is neither  covered nor eligible to be covered by a subsidized health insurance plan maintained by an employer of the self-employed person (whose self-employment might be a sideline) or the self-employed person's spouse. In other words, just having the plan coverage available through the wife's employment, even though one disdains taking it, is sufficient to make a Line 29 deduction impermissible.  So, AGI is increased. Health insurance premiums can be deducted on Schedule A but only to the extent that they (together with other medical costs) exceed 10% of AGI. For many people in good health, this means no deduction there either. Thus, when comparing the premiums of health insurance policies, one should pay some attention to the tax issues too. Health insurance  through a spouse's employment might not be that bad a deal after all.""
 ""I'm not sure about reimbursement, you'll have to talk to a tax adviser (CPA/EA licensed in your State). From what I know, if you pay your own insurance premiums - they're not deductible, and I don't think reimbursements change that. But again - not sure, verify. However, since you're a salaried employee, even if your own, you can have your employer cover you by a group plan. Even if the group consists of only you. Then, you'll pay your portion as part of the pre-tax salary deduction, and it will be deductible. The employer's portion is a legitimate business expense. Thus, since both the employee and the employer portions are pre-tax - the whole cost of the insurance will be pre-tax. The catch is this: this option has to be available to all of your employees. So if you're hiring an employee a year from now to help you - that employee will be eligible to exactly the same options you have. You cannot only cover owner-employees. If you don't plan on hiring employees any time soon, this point is moot for you, but it is something to keep in mind down the road as you're building and growing your business.""]"
How can I deposit a check made out to my business into my personal account?,"['You should have a separate business account. Mixing business and personal funds is a bad practice. Shop around, you should be able to find a bank that will let you open a free checking account, especially if you are going to have minimal activity (e.g. less than 20 of checks per month) and perhaps maintain a small balance (e.g. $100 or $500).'

Worse still they only have your word for it that you actually own the company, and aren't ripping off your employer by pocketing their payment. Even worse, when the company is audited and finds that cheque, the person who wrote it will have to justify and document why they made it out to you or risk being charged with embezzlement.

S-Corps are separate legal entities from their owners, and their profits and losses are reported on a separate tax return, Form 1120S. The owners or shareholders then report their share of the corporation's income or loss on their individual tax returns.

You will also need to pay yourself a reasonable salary as an employee of the S-Corp and report that income on your personal tax return. Any additional profits can be distributed to yourself as a shareholder, which may be subject to different tax treatment.

 'I am surprised no one has mentioned the two biggest things (in my opinion).  Or I should say, the two biggest things to me.  First, 1099 have to file quarterly self employment taxes.  I do not know for certain but I have heard that often times you will end up paying more this way then even a W-2 employees.  Second, an LLC allows you to deduct business expenses off the top prior to determining what you pay in taxes as pass-through income.  With 1099 you pay the same taxes regardless of your business expenses unless they are specifically allowed as a 1099 contractor (which most are not I believe).  So what you should really do is figure out the expense you incur as a result of doing your business and check with an accountant to see if those expenses would be deductible in an LLC and if it offsets a decent amount of your income to see if it would be worth it.  But I have read a lot of books and listened to a lot of interviews about wealthy people and most deal in companies not contracts.  Most would open a new business and add clients rather than dealing in 1099 contracts.  Just my two cents... Good luck and much prosperity.'

Once you have done this it changes the game on how you can pay out what your company makes.  You will need to employ yourself and give a """"reasonable"""" salary.  This will be reported to the IRS and you will file your normal tax returns and they will be taxed based on your situation. Now as the sole member you can then pay yourself """"distribution to share holders"""" from your account and this money is not subject to normal fica and social security tax (check with your tax guy) and MAKE SURE to document correctly.  The other thing is that on that same form you can elect to have a different fiscal year than the standard calendar IRS tax year.  This means that you could then take part of profits in one tax year and part in another so that you don\'t bump yourself into another tax bracket.  Example:  You cut a deal and the company makes 100,000 in profit that you want to take as a distribution.  If you wrote yourself a check for all of it then it could put you into another tax bracket.  If your fiscal year were to end say on sept 30 and you cut the deal before that date then you could write say 50,000 this year and then on jan 1 write the other check.""']"
Using credit card points to pay for tax deductible business expenses,"['""For simplicity, let\'s start by just considering cash back. In general, cash back from credit cards for personal use is not taxable, but for business use it is taxable (sort of, I\'ll explain later). The reason is most personal purchases are made with after tax dollars; you typically aren\'t deducting the cost of what you purchased from your personal income, so if you purchase something that costs $100 and you receive $2 back from the CC company, effectively you have paid $98 for that item but that wouldn\'t affect your tax bill. However, since businesses typically deduct most expenses, that same $100 deduction would have only been a $98 deduction for business tax purposes, so in this case the $2 should be accounted for. Note, you should not consider that $2 as income though; that would artificially inflate your revenue. It should be treated as a negative expense, similar to how you would handle returning an item you purchased and receiving a CC refund. Now for your specific questions: Part 1: As a small business owner, I wish to attend an annual seminar to improve my business. I have enough credit card reward points to cover the airfare, hotel, and rental car. Will those expenses still be deductible at the value displayed on the receipt? Effectively no, these expenses are not deductible. If you deduct them they will be completely counter-acted by the """"refund"""" you receive for the payments. Part 2: Does it matter if those points are accrued on my personal credit card, rather than a business credit card? This is where it gets hairy. Suppose your company policy is that employees make purchases with their own personal credit cards and submit receipts for reimbursement. In this case the employer can simply reimburse and would not know or care if the employee is racking up rewards/points/cashback. The trick is, as the employee, you must always purchase business related items normally so you have receipts to show, and if you receive cashback on the side there seems to be a """"don\'t ask, don\'t tell"""" rule that the IRS is OK with. It works the same way with heavy business travelers and airline miles- the free vacations those users get as perks are not treated as taxable income. However, I would not go out of my way to abuse this """"loophole"""". Typically, things like travel (airfare, hotel, car rental, meals) are expected. But I wouldn\'t go purchase 100 company laptops on your personal card and ask the company to reimburse you. The company should purchase those 100 laptops on a company card and effectively reduce the sale price by the cashback received. (Or more realistically, negotiate a better discount with your account rep and just cut them a check.) Part 3: Would there be any difference between credit card points and brand-loyalty points? If the rental car were paid for with points earned directly on the rental car company\'s loyalty system (not a CC), would that yield a different result? There is no difference. Perhaps the simplest way to think about this is you can only deduct an expense that you actually incur. In other words, the expense should show up on a bank or CC statement. This is why when you volunteer and work 10 hours for a charity, you can\'t call that a """"donation"""" of any amount of money because there is no actual payment made that would show up on a bank statement. Instead you could have billed the charity for your 10 hours of work, and then turned around and donated that same amount back to them, but it ends up being a wash.""']","Using credit card points to pay for tax deductible business expenses would not be considered deductible. The expenses covered by the credit card points would be counter-acted by the ""refund"" received for the payments.","Using credit card points to pay for tax deductible business expenses can be a smart financial move. Many credit card rewards programs allow you to redeem points for various rewards, including statement credits or gift cards that can be used towards business expenses. By using these points to offset the costs of tax deductible expenses, you can effectively reduce your overall business expenses and potentially lower your tax liability.

To take advantage of this strategy, you should first check with your credit card provider to understand the redemption options available to you. Some credit cards may have specific restrictions or limitations on how points can be redeemed for business expenses. Once you know the redemption options, you can determine if using points for tax deductible expenses makes sense for your business.

It's important to keep in mind that using credit card points for business expenses may have tax implications. In some cases, the IRS may consider the value of the redeemed points as taxable income. However, if the points are used to offset legitimate business expenses that are deductible, the tax impact may be minimized.

To ensure compliance with tax regulations, it is recommended to consult with a tax professional or accountant who can provide guidance specific to your situation. They can help you navigate any potential tax implications and ensure that you are maximizing the benefits of using credit card points for tax deductible business expenses.","Using credit card points to pay for tax deductible business expenses can be a bit tricky. Generally, if you use credit card points to cover business expenses, those expenses may not be deductible for tax purposes. This is because the points are considered a form of reimbursement or refund, which offsets the expense. However, if you have a company policy where employees use their personal credit cards for business expenses and then get reimbursed, the IRS seems to have a ""don't ask, don't tell"" rule regarding the rewards or points earned on those personal credit cards. In this case, as long as the expenses are legitimate business expenses and you have receipts to show, it may be acceptable to use credit card points to cover those expenses without affecting their deductibility. However, it's important not to abuse this loophole and use personal credit cards for excessive business expenses.

 '""There are two fundamentally different reasons merchants will give cash discounts. One is that they will not have to pay interchange fees on cash (or pay much lower fees on no-reward debit cards).  Gas stations in my home state of NJ already universally offer different cash and credit prices.  Costco will not even take Visa and MasterCard credit cards (debit only) for this reason. The second reason, not often talked about but widely known amongst smaller merchants, is that they can fail to declare the sale (or claim a smaller portion of the sale) to the authorities in order to reduce their tax liability.  Obviously the larger stores will not risk their jobs for this, but smaller owner-operated (""""mom and pop"""") stores often will.  This applies to both reduced sales tax liability and income tax liability.  This used to be more limited per sale (but more widespread overall), since tax authorities would look closely for a mismatch between declared income and spending, but with an ever-larger proportion of customers paying by credit card, merchants can take a bigger chunk of their cash sales off the books without drawing too much suspicion. Both of the above are more applicable to TVs than cars, since (1) car salesmen make substantial money from offering financing and (2) all cars must be registered with the state, so alternative records of sales abound.  Also, car prices tend to be at or near the credit limit of most cards, so it is not as common to pay for them in this way.""'

 '""I pay taxes on revenue.

However, here are some strategies that may increase your chances of achieving your financial goal:

1. Educate yourself: Gain a deep understanding of trading, investing, and business by reading books, attending seminars, or taking courses. This knowledge will help you make informed decisions and minimize risks.

2. Set clear financial goals: Define your target and create a detailed plan to achieve it. Break down your goal into smaller milestones and regularly evaluate your progress.

3. Diversify your investments: Spread your investments across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, or mutual funds. Diversification can help mitigate risks and increase potential returns.

4. Develop a long-term perspective: Instead of aiming for quick profits, focus on long-term growth. Invest in companies or assets with strong fundamentals and growth potential.

5. Monitor market trends: Stay updated on market news and trends that may impact your investments. This will help you make informed decisions and adjust your strategy accordingly.

6. Seek professional advice: Consider consulting with a financial advisor or a business mentor who can provide guidance and insights based on their expertise and experience.

7. Manage your risks: Be prepared for potential losses and have a risk management strategy in place. Set stop-loss orders, diversify your investments, and only invest what you can afford to lose.

8. Be disciplined and patient: Building wealth takes time and requires discipline. Stick to your plan, avoid emotional decision-making, and be patient with the ups and downs of the market.

Remember, investing and trading involve risks, and there are no guarantees of making a specific amount of money within a set timeframe. It is essential to do thorough research, assess your risk tolerance, and make informed decisions based on your individual circumstances.","There are a few potential ways to make $250,000 within 5 years through trading, investing, or business. Here are a few options:

1. Forex Trading: Some individuals claim that Forex trading can yield quick returns. However, it is important to note that Forex trading carries a high level of risk and requires significant capital to start with.

2. Stock Trading: While some people have made substantial profits from stock trading, it is important to approach it with caution. Stock trading can be risky and is often considered more of a gamble than a reliable source of income.

3. Long-term Investing: A more conservative approach would be to invest in the stock market for the long term. By consistently saving and investing a portion of your income in a diversified portfolio, you may be able to accumulate wealth over time. Historical data suggests that investing in the stock market can yield positive returns, but it is not guaranteed.

4. Starting a Business: Starting a successful business can potentially generate significant profits within a few years. However, entrepreneurship comes with its own set of challenges and risks. It requires careful planning, market research, and a solid business model.

It is important to note that there are no guarantees when it comes to making a specific amount of money within a specific timeframe.

These investors or lenders may provide the necessary capital based on your business plan, financial projections, or personal relationships.

2. Structuring the investment or business agreement: Once you have identified interested parties, you need to establish a formal agreement that outlines the terms and conditions of the investment or partnership. This agreement typically includes aspects such as the amount of money being invested or lent, the ownership or profit-sharing structure, the roles and responsibilities of each party, and the timeline for returns or repayment.

It is essential to have legal documentation, such as contracts or shareholder agreements, to protect the interests of all parties involved. These agreements also help establish clear expectations, rights, and obligations to ensure a smooth working relationship.

What approaches are there for pricing a small business?,"[""I don't have any experience in this, but this is my academic understanding of business pricing.

The amount the seller would like to pay for is going to be a multiple of its annual earnings. One example of this is the discounted cash flow analysis. You determine the EBITDA, the earnings a company generated, before interest,  depreciation, taxation and amortization.  Once you have this amount, you can project it out in perpetuity, or you use an industry multiplier.  Perpetuity:  You project this value out in perpituity, discounted by the going interest rate. In other words, if you project the business will earn $100,000/year, the business should grow at a 5% rate, and the going interest rate is 8%.

1. Market-Based Pricing: This approach involves setting the price based on the current market conditions and the prices of similar businesses in the industry. It requires researching and analyzing the competition to determine a competitive price point.

2. Cost-Based Pricing: With this approach, the price is determined by adding a markup to the costs incurred in producing or acquiring the product or service. This includes considering direct costs (such as materials and labor) and indirect costs (such as overhead expenses).

3. Value-Based Pricing: This approach focuses on the perceived value of the product or service to the customer. It involves pricing based on the benefits and unique features offered, rather than solely considering costs or competition. This approach works well if the business provides distinct value or has a differentiated product.

4. Profit-Based Pricing: This approach considers the desired profit margin and sets the price accordingly. It involves calculating the desired profit level and then determining the price that will achieve that goal.

5. Dynamic Pricing: This approach involves adjusting the price based on factors such as demand, seasonality, and customer behavior. It allows for flexible pricing based on market conditions and can be particularly useful in industries with fluctuating demand.

It is important for small businesses to carefully consider their target market, competitors, costs, and value proposition when determining the most appropriate pricing approach. Additionally, regularly reviewing and adapting the pricing strategy based on market changes and customer feedback is crucial for long-term success.","There are several approaches for pricing a small business.

I can either go out and find a client to invest 100,000$ and split profit and loss with them. Or, I could borrow 50,000$, pay 500$/year in interest, and get the same return and loss, while moving the market half as much (which would let me double my position!) In both cases the company is responsible for covering all fixed costs, like paying for traders, trades, office space, branding, management, regulatory compliance, etc. For your system to work, the cost to gather clients and interact with them has to be significantly less than 1% of the capital they provide you per year. At the 50% level, that might actually be worth it for the company in question.  Except at the 50% level you'd have really horrible returns even when the market went up.  So suppose a more reasonable level is the client keeps 75% of the returns (which compares to existing companies which offer larger investors an 80% cut on profits, but no coverage on losses). Now the cost to gather and interact with clients has to be lower than 2500$ per million dollars provided to beat out a simple loan arrangement.  A single sales employee with 100% overhead (office, all marketing, support, benefits) earning 40,000$/year has to bring in 32 million dollar-years worth of investment every year to break even. Cash is cheap.  Investment houses sell cash management, and charge for it.  They don't sell shared investment risk (at least not to retail investors), because it would take a lot of cash for it to be worth their bother. More explicitly, for this to be viable, they'd basically have to constantly arrange large hedges against the market going down to cover any losses.  That is the kind of thing that some margin loans may require.  That would all by itself lower their profits significantly, and they would be exposed to counter-party risk on top of that. It is much harder to come up with a pile of cash when the markets go down significantly.  If you are large enough to be worthwhile, finding a safe counterparty may be nearly impossible.""

 ""You are wildly over-estimating your taxes.  First, remember that your business expenses reduce your gross income.  Second, remember that taxes are progressive, so your flat 35% only applies if you're already making a high salary that pushed you into the higher brackets of US and CA. I think the deeper problems are: 1) you are expecting a super early start-up (with no finished product) to pay you the same as a steady job, including health insurance, and 2) you are expecting Kickstarter to independently fund the venture.

1. Separate personal and business finances: Start by separating your personal and business finances. Open a separate business bank account to keep track of all business-related transactions.

2. Create a starting balance: Determine the initial amount of money you put into the business from your personal funds. This will be the starting balance for your business bank account.

3. Record income: Create a record of all the money earned prior to establishing the business bank account. This includes any sales, services rendered, or other sources of income. Keep track of the dates, amounts, and details of each transaction.

4. Record expenses: Similarly, record all the expenses incurred prior to opening the business bank account. This includes any purchases, bills paid, or other business-related expenses. Again, note the dates, amounts, and details of each transaction.

5. Use a separate ledger or accounting software: Maintain a separate ledger or use accounting software to record these transactions. Include the income, expenses, and the starting balance in your records.

6. Reconcile with bank statements: Once you establish a business bank account, reconcile your records with the bank statements to ensure accuracy. Adjust any discrepancies between your records and the bank statements.

 ""Personally, I have a little checkbook program that I use to keep track of my spending and balance. Like you -- and I presume like most people -- I have certain recurring bills: the mortgage, insurance payments, car payment, etc. I simply enter these into the checkbook program about a month before the bill is due. Then I can run a transaction list that shows the date, amount, and remaining balance after each transaction. So if I want to know how much money I really have available to spend, I just look for the last transaction before my next payday, and see what the balance will be on that day. Personally, I always keep a certain amount of pad in my account so if I made a mistake and entered an incorrect amount for a check, or forgot to enter one completely, I don't overdraw the account. (I like to keep $1000 in such padding but that's way more than really necessary, it's very rare that I make a mistake of more than $100.) In my case, I don't enter electric bills or heating bills because I don't know the amount until I get the bill, and the amounts fall well within my padding, and for just two bills I can factor them in in my head. BTW I wrote this program myself but I'm sure there are similar products on the market. I used to use a spreadsheet and that worked pretty well. (Mainly I wrote the program because I have a tiny side business that I have to keep tax records for even though it makes almost no money.) You could in principle do it on paper, but the catch to that is that when you write payments on your paper ledger in advance of actually writing the check, you will often be writing down payments out of order, and so it becomes difficult to see what your balance is or was or will be on any given date. But a computer system can easily accept transactions out of order and then sort them and re-do the balance calculations in a fraction of a second.""
 ""Your account entries are generally correct, but do note that the last transaction is a mixture of the balance sheet and income statement.  If Quickbooks doesn't do this automatically then the expense must be manually removed from the balance sheet. The expense should be recognized on the balance sheet and income statement when it accrues, and it accrues when the prepaid rent is extinguished when consumed by the landlord, so that is when the second entry in your question should be booked. The cash flow statement will reflect all of these cash transactions immediately.""

 ""As a new (very!) small business, the IRS has lots of advice and information for you. Start at https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed and be sure you have several pots of coffee or other appropriate aid against somnolence.  By default a single-member LLC is 'disregarded' for tax purposes (at least for Federal, and generally states follow Federal although I don't know Mass. specifically), although it does have other effects. If you go this route you simply include the business income and expenses on Schedule C as part of your individual return on 1040, and the net SE income is included along with your other income (if any) in computing your tax. TurboTax or similar software should handle this for you, although you may need a premium version that costs a little more.  You can 'elect' to have the LLC taxed as a corporation by filing form 8832, see https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/limited-liability-company-llc . In principle you are supposed to do this when the entity is 'formed', but in practice AIUI if you do it by the end of the year they won't care at all, and if you do it after the end of the year but before or with your first affected return you qualify for automatic 'relief'. However, deciding how to divide the business income/profits into 'reasonable pay' to yourself versus 'dividends' is more complicated, and filling out corporation tax returns in addition to your individual return (which is still required) is more work, in addition to the work and cost of filing and reporting the LLC itself to your state of choice. Unless/until you make something like $50k-100k a year this probably isn't worth it. 1099 Reporting. Stripe qualifies as a 'payment network' and under a recent law payment networks must annually report to IRS (and copy to you) on form 1099-K if your account exceeds certain thresholds; see https://support.stripe.com/questions/will-i-receive-a-1099-k-and-what-do-i-do-with-it  . Note you are still legally required to report and pay tax on your SE income even if you aren't covered by 1099-K (or other) reporting. Self-employment tax. As a self-employed person (if the LLC is disregarded) you have to pay 'SE' tax that is effectively equivalent to the 'FICA' taxes that would be paid by your employer and you as an employee combined. This is 12.4% for Social Security unless/until your total earned income exceeds a cap (for 2017 $127,200, adjusted yearly for inflation), and 2.9% for Medicare with no limit (plus 'Additional Medicare' tax if you exceed a higher threshold and it isn't 'repealed and replaced'). If the LLC elects corporation status it has to pay you reasonable wages for your services, and withhold+pay FICA on those wages like any other employer. Estimated payments. You are required to pay most of your individual income tax, and SE tax if applicable, during the year (generally 90% of your tax or your tax minus $1,000 whichever is less). Most wage-earners don't notice this because it happens automatically through payroll withholding, but as self-employed you are responsible for making sufficient and timely estimated payments, and will owe a penalty if you don't. However, since this is your first year you may have a 'safe harbor'; if you also have income from an employer (reported on W-2, with withholding) and that withholding is sufficent to pay last year's tax, then you are exempt from the 'underpayment' penalty for this year.  If you elect corporation status then the corporation (which is really just you) must always make timely payments of withheld amounts, according to one of several different schedules that may apply depending on the amounts; I believe it also must make estimated payments for its own liability, if any, but I'm not familiar with that part.""
 '""If you start an LLC with you as the sole member it will be considered a disregarded entity.  This basically means that you have the protection of being a company, but all your revenues will go on your personal tax return and be taxed at whatever rate your personal rate calculates to based on your situation.  Now here is the good stuff.  If you file Form 2553 you can change your sole member LLC to file as an S Corp.  Once you have done this it changes the game on how you can pay out what your company makes.  You will need to employ yourself and give a """"reasonable"""" salary.  This will be reported to the IRS and you will file your normal tax returns and they will be taxed based on your situation. Now as the sole member you can then pay yourself """"distribution to share holders"""" from your account and this money is not subject to normal fica and social security tax (check with your tax guy) and MAKE SURE to document correctly.  The other thing is that on that same form you can elect to have a different fiscal year than the standard calendar IRS tax year.  This means that you could then take part of profits in one tax year and part in another so that you don\'t bump yourself into another tax bracket.  Example:  You cut a deal and the company makes 100,000 in profit that you want to take as a distribution.  If you wrote yourself a check for all of it then it could put you into another tax bracket.  If your fiscal year were to end say on sept 30 and you cut the deal before that date then you could write say 50,000 this year and then on jan 1 write the other check.""']"

 'A) The Credit Rating Agencies only look at the month-end totals that are on your credit card, as this is all they ever get from the issuing bank. So a higher usage frequency as described would not make any direct difference to your credit rating.

Typically, after two to three month, they reevaluate your credit limit, and it could go up considerably if you never overdrew (and at this time, it could indirectly positively affect your credit rating).

Additionally, you can try to improve your credit over time by consistently paying your bills on time and reducing your debt. This may take some time, but it can gradually improve your credit score.

It's also worth considering alternative lending options, such as credit unions or online lenders, who may be more willing to work with individuals with bad credit but good income.

 ""Generally, unless you explicitly elect otherwise, LLCs are transparent when it comes to taxes. So the money in the LLC is your money for tax purposes, there's no need to pay yourself a salary. In fact, the concept of salary for LLC members doesn't exist at all. It is either distributions or guaranteed payments (and even that is mostly relevant to multi-member LLCs). The only concern is the separation of personal and LLC finances - avoiding commingling. Mixing your personal and business expenses by using the same accounts/cards for both business and personal spending may cause troubles when it comes to the liability protection in case of a lawsuit. I'd suggest discussing this with a FL-licensed attorney.

Sole proprietorship or LLC?,"['""The primary advantage is protection of your personal assets. If your LLC gets sued, they can\'t take your house/car/dog/wife.

In addition to having to pay a Registered Agent (someone to act as my permanent mailing address in that state for ~$100/yr), apparently California likes to search for people just like me, and charge them $800 anyway. You can fight that, of course, and claim that your business really is done in Nevada, but do you really want to?""']",LLC,"The choice between a sole proprietorship and an LLC depends on various factors such as liability protection, tax implications, and business goals. 

A sole proprietorship is the simplest and most common form of business ownership where an individual runs and owns the business. It offers simplicity, minimal paperwork, and complete control over the business. However, the owner is personally liable for any debts or legal issues.

On the other hand, an LLC, or Limited Liability Company, provides limited liability protection to its owners, also known as members. This means that the members' personal assets are protected in case of any business liabilities or debts. LLCs also offer flexibility in terms of management structure and tax options.

It is advisable to consult with a legal and financial professional to assess your specific situation and determine which option, sole proprietorship or LLC, would be most suitable for your business.","Based on the provided context, it seems that forming an LLC would be more beneficial than operating as a sole proprietorship. An LLC provides a liability shield and allows for the protection of personal assets. Additionally, it offers flexibility in terms of taxation and the ability to pay oneself through distributions. However, it is important to consult with a tax professional or lawyer to fully understand the implications and benefits of each option in your specific situation.","[""There is some benefit to creating a corporation or LLC -- you theoretically have a liability shield. As Michael Pryor points out in his answer, though, there will probably be little difference if you get sued. Operating the corporation or LLC incurs some extra costs: you have to pay annual fees to the state, and there's a bit of extra administrative overhead (very little overhead for an LLC though).""
 '""If you start an LLC with you as the sole member it will be considered a disregarded entity.  This basically means that you have the protection of being a company, but all your revenues will go on your personal tax return and be taxed at whatever rate your personal rate calculates to based on your situation.  Now here is the good stuff.  If you file Form 2553 you can change your sole member LLC to file as an S Corp.  Once you have done this it changes the game on how you can pay out what your company makes.  You will need to employ yourself and give a """"reasonable"""" salary.  This will be reported to the IRS and you will file your normal tax returns and they will be taxed based on your situation. Now as the sole member you can then pay yourself """"distribution to share holders"""" from your account and this money is not subject to normal fica and social security tax (check with your tax guy) and MAKE SURE to document correctly.  The other thing is that on that same form you can elect to have a different fiscal year than the standard calendar IRS tax year.  This means that you could then take part of profits in one tax year and part in another so that you don\'t bump yourself into another tax bracket.  Example:  You cut a deal and the company makes 100,000 in profit that you want to take as a distribution.  If you wrote yourself a check for all of it then it could put you into another tax bracket.  If your fiscal year were to end say on sept 30 and you cut the deal before that date then you could write say 50,000 this year and then on jan 1 write the other check.""'

It is ultimately up to you and your friends to determine a fair percentage that you all agree upon.","The percentage of your company that you should have if you only put money will depend on various factors, such as the total amount of money you invested, the valuation of the company, and any agreements or negotiations you have with other stakeholders. It is recommended to consult with a financial advisor or legal professional who can provide specific guidance based on your unique circumstances.","A general rule of thumb is to avoid having more than 5% of your investments in any single stock, including your company stock. This is to avoid excessive risk. However, the ideal amount of company stock is probably 0%. It is generally recommended to diversify your investments to minimize risk.","['To me it depends on things like your net worth, debt, and how other assets are invested.   Currently you have 25K invested in the company you work for.   If you have 100K in student loans, are a renter, and 12K in your 401K, then I would recommend exercising almost all of your options.  In that case you have a much to large part of your world wrapped up in your company. If you have 250K in your 401K, own a home and have an emergency fund with no debt then you are fine with letting it ride.  You can afford to absorb a loss of 25K without wrecking your net worth. More than likely, you are somewhere in between (just statistics speaking there).  So why not exercise some of them now with the purpose of improving your financial situation?  Say do a 1/3 now and when they come available.   When 401ks were first invented people put almost all of their money in their company stock.  They lost just about everything when the company went down in value and were often a victim of layoffs exasperating the issue.  This is akin to the same situation.  Most financial advisers recommend against putting any 401K money to company stock, or at least limiting the amount.'
 ""I think better advice would be always max out your 401K at least to the level that the company provides a match. For example, my company will match 50% up to 10% of your salary. Good luck finding another investment with a guaranteed immediate 50% return. Beyond the company match, it is probably good advice to put as much in the 401K as you can afford if you aren't disciplined enough to invest that money on your own. Otherwise it depends on a number of factors as to whether it is better to invest on your own or in the company plan.""
 ""A general rule of thumb is to avoid having more than 5% of your investments in any single stock, to avoid excessive risk; it's usually even more risky if you're talking company stock because an adverse event could result in an inferior stock price and you getting laid off. Under other circumstances, the ideal amount of company stock is probably 0%. But there are tax benefits to waiting, as you've noted, and if you're reasonably confident that the stock isn't likely to jerk around too much, and you have a high risk tolerance (i.e. lots of extra savings besides this), and you're comfortable shouldering the risk of losing some money, it might make sense to hold onto the stock for a year - but never any longer. The real risk to holding a lot of company stock doesn't depend on how often you buy it and sell it per se, but having period purchases every month should make it easier for you to ladder the funds, and regularly sell your old shares as you purchase new shares. You might also consider a stop-loss order on the stock at or near the price you purchased it at. If the stock is at $100, then you buy at $85, and then the stock drops to $85, there are no more outstanding tax benefits and it makes no sense to have it as part of your portfolio instead of any other speculative instrument - you probably get better diversification benefits with any other speculative instrument, so your risk-adjusted returns would be higher.""
 ""Yes, you should be saving for retirement. There are a million ideas out there on how much is a reasonable amount, but I think most advisor would say at least 6 to 10% of your income, which in your case is around $15,000 per year. You give amounts in dollars. Are you in the U.S.? If so, there are at least two very good reasons to put money into a 401k or IRA rather than ordinary savings or investments: (a) Often your employer will make matching contributions. 50% up to 6% of your salary is pretty common, i.e. if you put in 6% they put in 3%. If either of your employers has such a plan, that's an instant 50% profit on your investment. (b) Any profits on money invested in an IRA or 401k are tax free. (Effectively, the mechanics differ depending on the type of account.) So if you put $100,000 into an IRA today and left it there until you retire 30 years later, it would likely earn something like  $600,000 over that time (assuming 7% per year growth). So you'd pay takes on your initial $100,000 but none on the $600,000. With your income you are likely in a high tax bracket, that would make a huge difference. If you're saying that you just can't find a way to put money away for retirement, may I suggest that you cut back on your spending. I understand that the average American family makes about $45,000 per year and somehow manages to live on that. If you were to put 10% of your income toward retirement, then you would be living on the remaining $171,000, which is still almost 4 times what the average family has. Yeah, I make more than $45,000 a year too and there are times when I think, How could anyone possibly live on that? But then I think about what I spend my money on. Did I really need to buy two new computer printers the last couple of months? I certainly could do my own cleaning rather than hiring a cleaning lady to come in twice a month. Etc. A tough decision to make can be paying off debt versus putting money into an investment account. If the likely return on investment is less than the interest rate on the loan, you should certainly concentrate on paying off the loan. But if the reverse is true, then you need to decide between likely returns and risk.""]"

2. Roth 401k: This option allows employees to contribute a portion of their after-tax income, and the contributions and investment gains can be withdrawn tax-free in retirement.

3. Safe Harbor 401k: This type of plan requires the employer to make contributions on behalf of all eligible employees, which helps satisfy certain non-discrimination testing requirements.

6. Profit Sharing Contributions: Employers can make discretionary contributions to employees' 401k accounts based on the company's profits. This option allows for flexibility in contribution amounts.

6. Contribution Limits: Employers must also consider the contribution limits set by the IRS. As of 2021, employees can contribute up to $19,500 to their 401(k) plan, with an additional catch-up contribution of $6,500 for those aged 50 and older.

It's important for employers to consult with a financial advisor or a retirement plan specialist to determine the best options for their specific company and employees.","[""Pre-Enron many companies forced the 401K match to be in company shares. That is no longer allowed becasue of changes in the law. Therefore most employees have only a small minority of their retirement savings in company shares. I know the ESOP and 401K aren't the same, but in my company every year the number of participants in the company stock purchase program decreases. The small number of participants and the small portion of their new retirement funds being in company shares would mean this spike in volume would be very small.  The ESOP plan for my employer takes money each paycheck, then purchases the shares once a quarter. This delay would allow them to manage the purchases better. I know with a previous employer most ESOP participants only held the shares for the minimum time, thus providing a steady steam of shares being sold.""
 ""I would always suggest rolling over 401(k) plans to traditional IRAs when possible.  Particularly, assuming there is enough money in them that you can get a fee-free account at somewhere like Fidelity or Vanguard.  This is for a couple of reasons. First off, it opens up your investment choices significantly and can allow you significantly reduced expenses related to the account.  You may be able to find a superior offering from Vanguard or Fidelity to what your employer's 401(k) plan allows; typically they only allow a small selection of funds to choose from.  You also may be able to reduce the overhead fees, as many 401(k) plans charge you an administrative fee for being in the plan separate from the funds' costs. Second, it allows you to condense 401(k)s over time; each time you change employers, you can rollover your 401(k) to your regular IRA and not have to deal with a bunch of different accounts with different passwords and such.  Even if they're all at the same provider, odds are you will have to use separate accounts. Third, it avoids issues if your employer goes out of business.  While 401(k) plans are generally fully funded (particularly for former employers who you don't have match or vesting concerns with), it can be a pain sometimes when the plan is terminated to access your funds - they may be locked for months while the bankruptcy court works things out. Finally, employers sometimes make it expensive for you to stay in - particularly if you do have a very small amount.  Don't assume you're allowed to stay in the former employer's 401(k) plan fee-free; the plan will have specific instructions for what to do if you change employers, and it may include being required to leave the plan - or more often, it could increase the fees associated with the plan if you stay in.  Getting out sometimes will save you significantly, even with a low-cost plan.""
 '""403b plans are used by school districts, colleges and universities, nonprofit hospitals, charitable foundations and the like for their employees while 401k plans are used by most everybody else. I would suspect that a school district etc can use a 401k plan instead of a 403b plan if it chooses to do so, but the reverse direction is most likely forbidden: a (for-profit) company cannot use a 403b plan. One difference between a 403b plan and a 401k plan is that the employer can choose to offer, and the employee can choose to purchase, stock in the company inside the 401k plan. This option obviously is not available to charities etc. which don\'t issue stock. Your comment that the 403b plan invests solely in (variable) annuities suggests that the plan administrator is an insurance company  and that the employer is moving to more """"modern"""" version that allows investments in mutual funds and the like. Forty years ago, my 403b plan was like that; the only investment choice was an annuity, but some time in the 1980s, the investment choices were broadened to include mutual funds (possibly because the 1986 Tax Reform Act changed the rules governing 403b plans).  So, are you sure that your employer is changing from a 403b plan to a 401k plan, or is it just a change of 403b plan administrator from the insurance company to another administrator who offers investment choices other than an annuity? Note, of course, that insurance companies have changed their options too. For example, TIAA (the Teachers\' Insurance and Annuity Association) which was the 403b plan administrator for many schools and colleges became TIAA/CREF (College Retirement Equities Fund) where the CREF mutual funds actually were pretty good investments.""'
 'If you were looking to maximize your ability to save in a qualified plan, why not setup a 401K plan in Company A and keep the SEP in B? Setup the 401K in A such that any employee can contribute 100% of their salary.  Then take a salary for around 19K/year (assuming under age 50), so you can contribute and have enough to cover SS taxes.   Then continue to move dividends to Company A, and continue the SEP in B.  This way if you are below age 50, you can contribute 54K (SEP limit) + 18K (IRA limit) + 5500 (ROTH income dependent) to a qualified plan.']"

It is essential to critically evaluate their recommendations, consider multiple sources of information, and tailor investment decisions to one's own financial situation.

Additionally, it is crucial to remember that financial markets are unpredictable, and past performance is not always indicative of future results. It is advisable to diversify one's investments and not solely rely on the advice of a single investment guru.

Also, they typically have a somewhat patriotic theme, helping your country to grow. In addition, many people don't really pay attention to the rate of the bonds, but are just investing in them. The more people investing in them, the lower the yields become. But the bottom line is, I would invest in a savings account any day over a negative interest rate...

If the bond has a callable option, the issuer can retire them  if conditions are favourable for the issuer, you can still loose some of your investment. Callable schedule should be in the bond issuer's prospectus while issuing the bond. If the issuer is in a different country, that brings along a lot of headaches of recovering your money if something goes bad i.e. forex rates can go up and down. YTM, when the bond was bought was greater than risk free rate(govt deposit rates) Has to be greater than the risk free rate, because of the extra risk you are taking. Reinvestment risk is less because of the short term involved(I am assuming 2-3 years at max), but you should also look at the coupon rate of your bond, if it isn't a zero-coupon bond, and how you invest that. would it be ideal to hold the bond till maturity irrespective of price change It always depends on the current conditions. You cannot be sure that everything is fine, so it pays to be vigilant. Check the health of the issuer, any adverse circumstances, and the overall economy as a whole.

If you need to do the split per-transaction for Quickbooks or something, that\'s annoying.  What Quickbooks says will be pennies off the method I describe above.  The state don\'t care as long as it\'s just pennies, or in their favor.""'

 'You should not open bank accounts just to get additional credit cards. You should be careful about carrying too many credit cards and incurring too much debt as you could find yourself in a situation whereby you may not be able to pay off your monthly interest, much less the principal balance. Credit cards are not insurance. With many years of experience under my belt I can tell you that the best approach is to live within (or below) your means and avoid carrying a balance on credit cards. I carry only one credit card (really a charge card) and I pay off the balance every month. Treat a credit card as a 30 day interest free loan and pay your balance off in full every month...as you progress through life you will save yourself a lot of heartache (and money) if you take this approach.'
 'Another thing to factor in are deals provided by banks. In general, banks care about new customers more than their existing customers. Hence they explicitly restrict the best deals on credit cards, savings accounts, etc, to new customers only. (Of course, there are occasionally good deals for existing customers, and some banks choose not to discriminate.) If you have many different bank accounts, you are making yourself unavailable for switching bonuses and introductory rates.'

Advantages:
1. Diversification of funds: By spreading your money across different banks, you reduce the risk of losing all your funds in case of a bank failure or financial crisis.
2. Access to better services: Different banks offer different features and benefits, so having multiple accounts can give you access to a wider range of services, such as better interest rates or lower fees.
3. Enhanced financial management: If you have specific financial goals or want to separate your personal and business finances, having multiple accounts can help you organize and track your money more effectively.

Disadvantages:
1. Increased complexity: Managing multiple accounts can be time-consuming and may require more effort to keep track of transactions, balances, and deadlines.
2. Higher fees: Some banks may charge fees for maintaining multiple accounts, so it's important to consider the costs involved before opening multiple accounts.
3. Potential credit impact: Opening multiple accounts can impact your credit score, as each account will be considered in your overall credit utilization and credit history.

In conclusion, having plenty of current accounts in different banks can be a wise choice if you carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages. It can provide diversification, access to better services, and improved financial management. However, it's important to weigh the potential complexity, fees, and credit impact before making this decision.","Having plenty of current accounts in different banks can have its advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, it can provide you with more flexibility and options for managing your finances. It can also help you spread out your funds and reduce the risk of losing all your money if one bank fails. Additionally, some banks offer different features and benefits, so having multiple accounts can allow you to take advantage of those.

On the other hand, having multiple accounts can also be a paperwork hassle and make it more difficult to keep track of your finances. It can also increase the risk of falling victim to fraud or identity theft, as each account becomes a potential target for criminals. Additionally, some banks may consider your total credit before giving you more, so having too many accounts may not necessarily increase your overall credit limit.

Ultimately, the decision to have plenty of current accounts in different banks depends on your personal preferences and financial goals. It's important to weigh the pros and cons and consider factors such as convenience, security, and the potential benefits of having multiple accounts.","[""I don't think there's any law against having lots of bank accounts.

 '""From my experience, payments from banks and other financial entities, such as loyalty programs, generally aren\'t as large as payments that go the other direction from consumer to bank. Thus, keeping a bank account open simply for some reward/loyalty points may just be changing your behavior for the wrong reasons. The more important scenario is whether or not you have any automated ACH payments or whether your bank account is linked to other services. Perhaps the biggest tell that you\'re in the clear is when those transactions start occurring from your credit union account.  For example: If you had a direct deposit to your BMO bank account, make sure you see deposits start to appear in the credit union account. If you\'re making automatic withdraws to an online savings or brokerage account, make sure those transfers are stopped and that you instead see them coming out of your new credit union account. You shouldn\'t need to move the auto loan, but you will need to make sure you can pay it from the new account.

"Accidentally opened a year term CD account, then realized I need the money sooner. What to do?","[""I did find this information from the US Department of the Treasury: What are the penalties for withdrawing money early from a Time Certificate of Deposit (CD)? Federal law stipulates that all time certificates of deposit (CD) that are cashed out early are subject to a minimum penalty. If you withdraw an amount within the first six days after deposit, the penalty consists of at least seven days' simple interest. Other than that, national banks can set their own penalties; there is no maximum. Additionally, you may want to review the Account Agreement that the bank provided when you opened the account, as it explains the early withdrawal penalties. Check the paperwork to see if there is a short period at the start where the penalty is minimal. Each bank can set their own rules for the maximum penalty. Some base it on x months interest, some as a percentage of the CD, others may use a more complex formula.""

2. Early withdrawal: Most CD accounts have penalties for early withdrawal, which means you may have to pay a fee or forfeit a portion of the interest earned. However, if you urgently need the money, this could be a viable option to consider.

3. Explore loan options: If you need the funds for a specific purpose, such as a major expense or emergency, you could explore loan options. This way, you can access the money you need while keeping your CD account intact.

4. Wait until maturity: If you can manage without the funds for the duration of the CD term, it may be best to wait until the maturity date. At that time, you can withdraw the money without any penalties or fees.

Remember, it is always advisable to consult with a financial advisor or contact the institution where you hold the CD account to discuss your specific situation and explore the best course of action.","If you need the money sooner than the maturity date of the CD, you have a few options.

Buying from an aggressive salesperson,"['""In my experience when a salesperson says a particular deal is only good if you purchase right now, 100% of the time it is not true. Of course I can\'t guarantee that is universally the case, but if you leave and come back 5 minutes later, or tomorrow, or next week, it\'s extremely likely that they\'ll still take your money for the original price. (In fact, sometimes after you leave you get a call with even a lower price than the """"excellent offer""""...) Most of the time when you are presented with high pressure sales accompanied by a """"this price is only good right now"""" pitch, it ends up being because they don\'t want you to go search the competition and read reviews. In this case you have already done that and deemed the item to be worthwhile. Perhaps a better tactic for the salesperson would have been to try to convince you that others are interested in the item and if you wait it might be sold to someone else at that excellent price. Sales is an art, and it requires the salesperson to size you up and try to figure out your vulnerability and exploit it. This particular salesperson obviously misjudged you and/or you don\'t have an easily exploitable vulnerability. I wouldn\'t let the shortcomings of the salesperson get in the way of your purchase. If you are worried about the scenario of someone else snatching up the item, consider offering a deposit to hold the item for a certain amount of time while you """"reflect"""" and/or """"arrange for the funds"""".""'

 '""This is way too long for a comment, so I am posting this as an answer. My bet is that you\'re buying a new piano. It is the only instrument that makes sense. The rest of this answer are going to assume this, but this should apply well if you\'re going after a violin or marimba for example. For those readers that do not know, a piano is a very delicate and expensive music instrument. My piano is literally more expensive than my car. There are a lot of similarities in sales negotiation between buying a piano and buying a car. You may be surprised to know that the cost for the dealer to acquire a piano is only around half the listed price. Therefore, the salesperson has a lot of room to negotiate a sale price to you. This explains why he was able to make a good offer for the model you are not intending to buy. You are best by comparing the final sale price with other similar models in your region, or the exact model around your region, which you have already did. Those indicate the standard price in your negotiation. You described the dealer had the exact model you desire, only in different appearance. I assume you want a black color while they have a white or wood-pattern one in their showroom. Note, every piano is different. Even with the exact same model, there will be very slight differences in the tune and touch, since some processes are hand finished. (If you\'re buying a Steinway, treat each of them as an individual hand crafted art.) Play the exact instrument you will be buying before closing the deal. If they do not have your desired model in the showroom, ask for a visit to their inventory facility. Again, play the exact instrument, not a showroom model. Some dishonest dealers will have their showroom pianos regulated and tuned differently than the """"standard"""" pianos from shipping. If you get an extremely good offer, proceed with caution. There may be defects in that particular instrument. Look for rust or oxidized layers on the strings. Look for groves in the hammers. Listen to clicking noises when playing the keys. These are signs that the instrument has been around for quite a while and they cannot sell it. You can also copy down the serial number and look up the manufacturing date online. Before you close the deal, ask for after-sale services. How many free tunings will they provide? Will they polish your piano after delivery? These are bargain chips you can use for final adjustment of the price.""'
 ""I often spend weeks or months (and sometimes even years) deciding whether to buy something. Certainly the dealer should recognize you by now if you take a third opportunity to look at the same instrument. You could politely remind him that you've twice declined his excellent prices. From there you can assert that you will purchase only when you are ready.""
 '""My advice is to quit worrying about the salesman\'s tactics.  They are a distraction.  What do you want?  How much are you willing to pay for it.  If you want the instrument, decide how much you want to pay for it.  Round down to the next even hundred.  Take that much in $100 bills.  Put the money in his hand and say, """"This is what I have, take it or leave it"""".  You must be prepared to walk out of the store without the instrument.""'
 '""I have a very simple rule. For anything other than trivial purchases (a small fraction of my monthly income), the only final decision I will make in the presence of a salesperson is """"No"""". After I have the terms nailed down, and still feel that I am likely to buy the item, I leave the store, car dealership etc., and think about it by myself. Often, I go to a mall coffee shop to do the thinking. If it is really big, I sleep on it and make my decision the next day. Once I have made my decision, I inform the salesperson. If the decision is """"No"""" I do not discuss my reasons - that gives them an overcome-the-objection lever. I just tell them I have decided not to buy the item, which is all they need to know.""'
 ""From your question and how you have framed it, I get you find Agressive Sales tactics disturb the buying process for you. ;) I understand because I also find the whole process of Research / Negotiating / Buying / Owning / Using is all on one continuum, so anything that ruins the process will likely lose the sale or enjoyment of the item, at the end of the day.  [Very long answer .... Sorry :) ] The answer to this is to KNOW what you want before you have to deal with the Sales people. A good Sales person likes a customer who knows what they want. I would suggest that you follow my 'Buying Process' (Much you have already done) : Before you Buy: Identify the item you want and the max/min 'realistic' price you  would buy at. [Stick to this price else 'Buyers Remorse' may bite  later.] Write the questions you have down on paper before you visit the    Dealer. Write the answers you want on the same list, if known. Decide which questions are most important and therefore must get the  answer you want. These should be the questions you ask first. Mark  these on the list. Re-visit points 1-3 are they complete and to your satisfaction ? Would you buy if all the answers & the price are right ? If NO then re-visit point 1-3 else you are not ready to buy now !!! If YES then Organise your visit to the Dealer. [Book appointment etc if needed.] At Dealer: Meet your Sales person and clearly state what you want (the item) and importantly when you intend to buy, if all your questions are answered to your satisfaction.  There is no need to discuss price at this point as the 'haggling' is only possible IF the questions are answered to your satisfaction. Do not give information such as your maximum budget or similar requests, as they give the sales person the upper hand to maximise his/her pricing.  If asked state that your budget is conditional on the answers you get. As the questions are answered assess the answer and assign +/- to the question on your list. If any of your most critical / important questions are answered in the negative, they are the reasons you have to call it a day and walk out. You can assess whether they are worth ignoring but you will need to factor this into your price and if you have identified your questions correctly there should be little room for debate. Assuming you have got all your questions answered you should know what you are buying and have assessed what is a reasonable price for it, if you still want it as this point.  If you have lost interest, say so and let the Sales person go. Don't waste their time. They may make some sort of offer to you BUT don't forget that if you have doubts now they will not go away easily no matter what the 'great' price is. If you want it then continue. Buying your Item: [None of the following is really usefull if you have told the Sales person your Budget, as they will be aiming for the highest end of your budget. You will often find that the best price is very close to your maximum budget !!! :)] Do not forget your realistic price range, this should limit your buying price no matter what tactics are used by the Sales person. Only you know what you are prepared to pay and if an extra 1% or 50% is considered worth it to you, if you have to have the item :) Regardless, you have to have some idea of your limit and be prepared to stick to it. You must be able to walk away if the price is silly and not worth it. Assuming you have not been smitten by your item and funds are NOT unlimited, ask for the price and assess it against your price range. At this point I can only offer pointers as there are no 'magic' rules to get what you want at the lowest price. The only advice I would offer is that you will be lucky to get something at your 1st offer price unless the seller really needs to sell, because of this your 1st offer should be less than your price range lowest band. You will need to assess how much less but be prepared to get a 'No' response. If you get a 'Yes' and your research is good 'Buy It !!!' If you get too enthusiastic a response, question your research & if not sure bail out [No Sale] :) At this point you are likely to be 'Haggling' so you need to be ready for all the 'Must buy Now' tactics. If you have clearly stated your wants and timescales there is no reason to be pulled in by these tactics and they can be ignored until the price has reached the level you are happy with. If the price is not moving where you want than clearly state you cannot 'buy at that price'. If you get a total stop and no movement than you need to assess your 'need' and if priced too high then you should walk out. Remember if you stated that you had a timescale to buy of 1/2/3 weeks you should act like you have 1/2/3 weeks to keep looking. Any eagerness on your part will tell the Sales person that you have lied !!! :) You can always come back and try again, reminding the Sales person that the 'item' is still there and perhaps it is priced too high to sell and make the same offer. !!! (A bit of cheek sometimes works.) If the price is close and you still want it and the Sales person is not moving you need to try walking out while stating that you would love the 'item' if it was priced better, if no improved offer as you go, try an increased offer but again you need to assess how much and remember you can only go up, or walk out and come back another day. If the price is at a level you are happy with then you should have no reason not to buy (if you have followed this process) but this does not mean that you should be forced into buying now if you do not want to. Regardless of any 'Must buy now' tactics if the price is right and you cannot buy now, tell the Sales person when you CAN buy and see if you can get an agreement with this. It is unfair to expect a price to be held for an indeterminate time, so you do need to state when you could buy if not now when a price has been agreed. This is a point where the deal may break down if the Sales person thinks they have a sale and trys to force the Sale now. Once again you have to assess your 'need' and whether buying now is better than walking out. If the deal breaks down there is nothing stopping you from coming back and offering the same price when you can buy. A final option is to agree if a deposit can be left to reserve the item until you can buy. This gives the Sales person some assurance that you will come back and is sometimes NON-Refundable unless you agree otherwise before you pay, so check this detail first. (This tends to be smaller Dealers but generally in the UK the large companies offer refundable deposits as part of their Customer Service, the advantage of using larger Stores/Dealers etc.) Apologies for the epic reply, hope it helps.""
 '""He sounds like a very bad salesman and I should know, because I was a sales manager at a bike shop which sold bikes from $200 to $10k. Now I had a clear goal, which is to sell as many bikes at the highest price possible, but I didn\'t do that by making customers uncomfortable. Each customer received different treatment depending on what they were looking for.  For example, the $200 beach cruiser buyer was going to be told """"You look great on that bike... can I ring you up?"""", whereas the racer interested in saving grams will receive a detailed discussion about his bike options.  The $200 bike customer won\'t have very sophisticated questions (although I could give a lecture on cruisers), so giving out too much info complicates a likely quick impulse buy.  On the other hand, we are building a relationship with the racer which will include detailed fitting sessions and time-consuming mechanical service.  While I also want to close a high priced sale, it will take several visits to prove both I have the right bike and this is the best shop. But no matter what you were buying, I was always pleasant and unhurried, and my customers left happy.   Specifically with this situation of high pressure tactics, the problem is the competition with internet sales.  Often customers will have only 2 criteria, the model and the price, and if a shop does not meet both, the customer walks right out.   Possibly this sales guy is a bit cynical with his tactics, but the reality is that if you have no relationship with that shop, you fall into the category of internet buyer.  One thing the sales guy could have done was not tell you we wasn\'t going to honor this price if you came back.  Occasionally there would be an internet buyer, and I showed no unpleasantness even though internet sellers could crush our brick and mortar shop.  I would mention a competitive price and if he bought it, great, and if not, that\'s just business.   As for the buyer, I would treat these tactics with a certain detachment.  I would personally chuckle at his treatment and ask if I could kick the tires, an user car saying.   I suppose the bottom line is if you are ready to buy this specific model, and if the price is right (and the shop is ethical so you won\'t get ripped off with garbage), then you have to be ready to buy on the spot. I will point out one horrible experience I had at a car dealership.  I came in 15 minutes before closing and a sales person gave me a price almost a third cheaper than list.  I wasn\'t ready to buy on my first visit ever to a dealership and of course, buying a car has all kinds of hidden fees.  I asked will this be the price tomorrow, and he said absolutely not.  I told him, """"so if I come in tomorrow morning, your dealer clock has only gone 15 minutes"""" but that logic did not register with him.   Maybe he thought I was going to spend 15k on the spot and pressure tactics would work on me.  I never came back, but I did go another dealership and bought a car after a reasonable negotiation.""'
 ""As described by the other answers, there are pretty harmless explanations for that behaviour. You could be slightly worried because he gave you exceptionally good deals for both instruments, but that's neither here nor there. Maybe he simply prices all items way up to be able to give a great discount on either sale. You can't ever know; the actual price you pay in the end is what counts. What I would do: If I expect in advance (or if I notice during the negotiation) that I am put under pressure in this way, I usually try to do exactly the same, in reverse. That is, I take  a minute to explain up front that I will not, under any circumstance, buy right now, but that this is a purely informational event. I will make sure not to have my money/card with me. Any high-end salesman worth his sale should have no problem with that at all. Money aside, you are shopping for something that will mean a lot to you. The salesman is not some peddler of arbitrary wares. Everybody understands that not only do you not want to pay too high a price, but also that you want to really get the item you want, and want to be happy with it for a long time. This is a tough decision, often, and if the salesman cannot, or does not want to respect that, then it would be a clear signal for me that dubious things are going on. In fact, you would probably be unhappier if you got the wrong item for a great price than if you got a great item for a slightly too-high price. That is something you should probably not tell the salesman ;), but can keep in mind. So getting the greatest deal of all times is probably not so high on your priority list.""

How can I deal effectively with those tactics?” And you state this as well: “To make a long story short, the dealer's aggressive sales tactics have made me somewhat uncomfortable.” And finally ask: “How can I deal effectively with those tactics?” Okay, first and foremost if you feel discomfort in anything in life—not just a financial situation—just walk away. You might have to say “No…” when doing this but it’s not always the case you will have to counter aggression with aggression.

It is important to deal effectively with these tactics by asserting your own needs and boundaries, and being prepared to walk away from the transaction if you are not comfortable. Trust your instincts and prioritize your own satisfaction and peace of mind in the buying process.","When buying from an aggressive salesperson, it is important to stay calm and not let their tactics pressure you into making a hasty decision. Remember that you are in control of your purchasing decisions and have the right to take your time and consider all options. If the salesperson is being overly pushy or making you feel uncomfortable, it may be best to politely decline their offer and seek out a different salesperson or store where you feel more comfortable. It is important to prioritize your own needs and preferences when making a purchase, rather than succumbing to aggressive sales tactics.","When dealing with an aggressive salesperson, it's important to stay calm and not let their tactics pressure you into making a decision you're not comfortable with. Here are some tips for dealing with an aggressive salesperson:

1. Set your boundaries: Clearly communicate your needs and expectations to the salesperson. Let them know that you prefer a more relaxed and informative approach rather than high-pressure tactics.

2. Take your time: Don't feel rushed into making a decision. Take the time to research and compare prices, read reviews, and gather all the information you need before committing to a purchase.

3. Be firm: If the salesperson is being overly pushy or aggressive, don't be afraid to assert yourself and firmly express your discomfort. Let them know that you need space to make a decision and that their tactics are not helping.

4. Walk away if necessary: If the salesperson continues to be aggressive or if you feel uncomfortable, it's perfectly acceptable to walk away from the transaction. Remember, there are plenty of other options available, and it's better to find a seller who treats you with respect and makes you feel comfortable.

5. Trust your instincts: If something doesn't feel right or if you have doubts about the salesperson or the deal, trust your gut. It's better to err on the side of caution and find a different seller who aligns better with your needs and preferences.

Remember, you have the power as a consumer to choose where and how you spend your money. Don't settle for a negative buying experience just to save a few dollars.","[""If something in any transaction in life—financial or otherwise—doesn’t make you feel comfortable and the choice is between saving money with one thing versus another, don’t sell your personal needs short.

 '""He sounds like a very bad salesman and I should know, because I was a sales manager at a bike shop which sold bikes from $200 to $10k. Now I had a clear goal, which is to sell as many bikes at the highest price possible, but I didn\'t do that by making customers uncomfortable. Each customer received different treatment depending on what they were looking for.  For example, the $200 beach cruiser buyer was going to be told """"You look great on that bike... can I ring you up?"""", whereas the racer interested in saving grams will receive a detailed discussion about his bike options.  The $200 bike customer won\'t have very sophisticated questions (although I could give a lecture on cruisers), so giving out too much info complicates a likely quick impulse buy.  On the other hand, we are building a relationship with the racer which will include detailed fitting sessions and time-consuming mechanical service.  While I also want to close a high priced sale, it will take several visits to prove both I have the right bike and this is the best shop. But no matter what you were buying, I was always pleasant and unhurried, and my customers left happy.   Specifically with this situation of high pressure tactics, the problem is the competition with internet sales.  Often customers will have only 2 criteria, the model and the price, and if a shop does not meet both, the customer walks right out.   Possibly this sales guy is a bit cynical with his tactics, but the reality is that if you have no relationship with that shop, you fall into the category of internet buyer.  One thing the sales guy could have done was not tell you we wasn\'t going to honor this price if you came back.  Occasionally there would be an internet buyer, and I showed no unpleasantness even though internet sellers could crush our brick and mortar shop.  I would mention a competitive price and if he bought it, great, and if not, that\'s just business.   As for the buyer, I would treat these tactics with a certain detachment.  I would personally chuckle at his treatment and ask if I could kick the tires, an user car saying.   I suppose the bottom line is if you are ready to buy this specific model, and if the price is right (and the shop is ethical so you won\'t get ripped off with garbage), then you have to be ready to buy on the spot. I will point out one horrible experience I had at a car dealership.  I came in 15 minutes before closing and a sales person gave me a price almost a third cheaper than list.  I wasn\'t ready to buy on my first visit ever to a dealership and of course, buying a car has all kinds of hidden fees.  I asked will this be the price tomorrow, and he said absolutely not.  I told him, """"so if I come in tomorrow morning, your dealer clock has only gone 15 minutes"""" but that logic did not register with him.   Maybe he thought I was going to spend 15k on the spot and pressure tactics would work on me.  I never came back, but I did go another dealership and bought a car after a reasonable negotiation.""'
 '""In my experience when a salesperson says a particular deal is only good if you purchase right now, 100% of the time it is not true. Of course I can\'t guarantee that is universally the case, but if you leave and come back 5 minutes later, or tomorrow, or next week, it\'s extremely likely that they\'ll still take your money for the original price. (In fact, sometimes after you leave you get a call with even a lower price than the """"excellent offer""""...) Most of the time when you are presented with high pressure sales accompanied by a """"this price is only good right now"""" pitch, it ends up being because they don\'t want you to go search the competition and read reviews. In this case you have already done that and deemed the item to be worthwhile. Perhaps a better tactic for the salesperson would have been to try to convince you that others are interested in the item and if you wait it might be sold to someone else at that excellent price. Sales is an art, and it requires the salesperson to size you up and try to figure out your vulnerability and exploit it. This particular salesperson obviously misjudged you and/or you don\'t have an easily exploitable vulnerability. I wouldn\'t let the shortcomings of the salesperson get in the way of your purchase. If you are worried about the scenario of someone else snatching up the item, consider offering a deposit to hold the item for a certain amount of time while you """"reflect"""" and/or """"arrange for the funds"""".""'
 ""From your question and how you have framed it, I get you find Agressive Sales tactics disturb the buying process for you. ;) I understand because I also find the whole process of Research / Negotiating / Buying / Owning / Using is all on one continuum, so anything that ruins the process will likely lose the sale or enjoyment of the item, at the end of the day.  [Very long answer .... Sorry :) ] The answer to this is to KNOW what you want before you have to deal with the Sales people. A good Sales person likes a customer who knows what they want. I would suggest that you follow my 'Buying Process' (Much you have already done) : Before you Buy: Identify the item you want and the max/min 'realistic' price you  would buy at. [Stick to this price else 'Buyers Remorse' may bite  later.] Write the questions you have down on paper before you visit the    Dealer. Write the answers you want on the same list, if known. Decide which questions are most important and therefore must get the  answer you want. These should be the questions you ask first. Mark  these on the list. Re-visit points 1-3 are they complete and to your satisfaction ? Would you buy if all the answers & the price are right ? If NO then re-visit point 1-3 else you are not ready to buy now !!! If YES then Organise your visit to the Dealer. [Book appointment etc if needed.] At Dealer: Meet your Sales person and clearly state what you want (the item) and importantly when you intend to buy, if all your questions are answered to your satisfaction.  There is no need to discuss price at this point as the 'haggling' is only possible IF the questions are answered to your satisfaction. Do not give information such as your maximum budget or similar requests, as they give the sales person the upper hand to maximise his/her pricing.  If asked state that your budget is conditional on the answers you get. As the questions are answered assess the answer and assign +/- to the question on your list. If any of your most critical / important questions are answered in the negative, they are the reasons you have to call it a day and walk out. You can assess whether they are worth ignoring but you will need to factor this into your price and if you have identified your questions correctly there should be little room for debate. Assuming you have got all your questions answered you should know what you are buying and have assessed what is a reasonable price for it, if you still want it as this point.  If you have lost interest, say so and let the Sales person go. Don't waste their time. They may make some sort of offer to you BUT don't forget that if you have doubts now they will not go away easily no matter what the 'great' price is. If you want it then continue. Buying your Item: [None of the following is really usefull if you have told the Sales person your Budget, as they will be aiming for the highest end of your budget. You will often find that the best price is very close to your maximum budget !!! :)] Do not forget your realistic price range, this should limit your buying price no matter what tactics are used by the Sales person. Only you know what you are prepared to pay and if an extra 1% or 50% is considered worth it to you, if you have to have the item :) Regardless, you have to have some idea of your limit and be prepared to stick to it. You must be able to walk away if the price is silly and not worth it. Assuming you have not been smitten by your item and funds are NOT unlimited, ask for the price and assess it against your price range. At this point I can only offer pointers as there are no 'magic' rules to get what you want at the lowest price. The only advice I would offer is that you will be lucky to get something at your 1st offer price unless the seller really needs to sell, because of this your 1st offer should be less than your price range lowest band. You will need to assess how much less but be prepared to get a 'No' response. If you get a 'Yes' and your research is good 'Buy It !!!' If you get too enthusiastic a response, question your research & if not sure bail out [No Sale] :) At this point you are likely to be 'Haggling' so you need to be ready for all the 'Must buy Now' tactics. If you have clearly stated your wants and timescales there is no reason to be pulled in by these tactics and they can be ignored until the price has reached the level you are happy with. If the price is not moving where you want than clearly state you cannot 'buy at that price'. If you get a total stop and no movement than you need to assess your 'need' and if priced too high then you should walk out. Remember if you stated that you had a timescale to buy of 1/2/3 weeks you should act like you have 1/2/3 weeks to keep looking. Any eagerness on your part will tell the Sales person that you have lied !!! :) You can always come back and try again, reminding the Sales person that the 'item' is still there and perhaps it is priced too high to sell and make the same offer. !!! (A bit of cheek sometimes works.) If the price is close and you still want it and the Sales person is not moving you need to try walking out while stating that you would love the 'item' if it was priced better, if no improved offer as you go, try an increased offer but again you need to assess how much and remember you can only go up, or walk out and come back another day. If the price is at a level you are happy with then you should have no reason not to buy (if you have followed this process) but this does not mean that you should be forced into buying now if you do not want to. Regardless of any 'Must buy now' tactics if the price is right and you cannot buy now, tell the Sales person when you CAN buy and see if you can get an agreement with this. It is unfair to expect a price to be held for an indeterminate time, so you do need to state when you could buy if not now when a price has been agreed. This is a point where the deal may break down if the Sales person thinks they have a sale and trys to force the Sale now. Once again you have to assess your 'need' and whether buying now is better than walking out. If the deal breaks down there is nothing stopping you from coming back and offering the same price when you can buy. A final option is to agree if a deposit can be left to reserve the item until you can buy. This gives the Sales person some assurance that you will come back and is sometimes NON-Refundable unless you agree otherwise before you pay, so check this detail first. (This tends to be smaller Dealers but generally in the UK the large companies offer refundable deposits as part of their Customer Service, the advantage of using larger Stores/Dealers etc.) Apologies for the epic reply, hope it helps.""]"
Credit and Debit,"[""It took me a while to understand the concept, so I'll break it down as best as I can.  There are three parts to the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity We'll look at this in two ways   1. As a business owner you invest (say) 10,000 USD into your bank. The entry would be: Debit: Assets: Cash for 10,000    Credit: Owner's Equity: Contributions for 10,000 In this case, you have assets of 10,000 from your deposit, but it is due to owner contributions and not business transactions. Another example (say a sale):  Debit: Assets: Cash for 10,000    Credit: Owner's Equity: Sales for 10,000 Debit: Assets: Cash for 10,000    Credit: Liabilities: Deposits for 10,000 Deposits are a banking term to reflect a bank's obligation to return the amount on demand (though the bank has free reign with it, see fractional banking)  You will NEVER debit or credit your bank as it is assumed you will be storing your money there, note bank reconciliation. Hope this helps, comment with any more questions.""
 ""In view of business, we have to book the entries. Business view, owner and business are different. When capital is invested in business by owner, in future business has to repay it.  That's why, capital always credit. When we come about  bank (business prospective) - cash, bank, fd are like assets which can help in the business. Bank is current asset (Real account) - Debit (what comes into the business)                                        Credit (what goes out of the business) Hence credit and debit differs from what type of account is it.... credit - when business liables debit - what business has and receivables""]","Credit and debit refer to the recording of financial transactions in accounting. The context provided explains that credit is used when there is an increase in owner's equity or liabilities, while debit is used when there is an increase in assets or receivables. The specific accounts to be credited or debited depend on the type of transaction and the nature of the account.","Credit and debit are two different types of financial transactions. 

Credit refers to a transaction where an individual or business receives funds or goods with the promise to pay for them later. It is essentially borrowing money or extending credit from a lender or vendor. Examples of credit transactions include credit card purchases, loans from banks, or buying goods on credit from a supplier.

On the other hand, debit refers to a transaction where funds are directly withdrawn from a bank account or deducted from an individual's available balance. It is an immediate payment method where the funds are taken out of the account at the time of the transaction. Examples of debit transactions include using a debit card for purchases, writing a check, or making online payments directly from a bank account.

In summary, credit involves borrowing money or goods with the promise to pay later, while debit involves immediate payment by deducting funds from a bank account.","Credit and debit are terms used in accounting to record the flow of money or value in a transaction. 

Debit refers to an entry that increases an asset or expense account, or decreases a liability or equity account. It represents the inflow of assets or the outflow of liabilities or equity.

Credit, on the other hand, refers to an entry that increases a liability or equity account, or decreases an asset or expense account. It represents the inflow of liabilities or equity or the outflow of assets or expenses.

In double-entry accounting, every transaction must have at least one debit and one credit entry, and the total debits must equal the total credits. This ensures that the accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity) remains in balance.","['""Exactly what accounts are affected by any given transaction is not a fixed thing. Just for example, in a simple accounting system you might have one account for """"stock on hand"""". In a more complex system you might have this broken out into many accounts for different types of stock, stock in different locations, etc. So I can only suggest example specific accounts. But account type -- asset, liability, capital (or """"equity""""), income, expense -- should be universal. Debit and credit rules should be universal. 1: Sold product on account: You say it cost you $500 to produce. You don\'t say the selling price, but let\'s say it\'s, oh, $700. Credit (decrease) Asset """"Stock on hand"""" by $500. Debit (increase) Asset """"Accounts receivable"""" by $700. Credit (increase) Income """"Sales"""" by $700. Debit (increase) Expense """"Cost of goods sold"""" by $500. 2: $1000 spent on wedding party by friend I\'m not sure how your friend\'s expenses affect your accounts. Are you asking how he would record this expense? Did you pay it for him? Are you expecting him to pay you back? Did he pay with cash, check, a credit card, bought on credit? I just don\'t know what\'s happening here. But just for example, if you\'re asking how your friend would record this in his own records, and if he paid by check: Credit (decrease) Asset """"checking account"""" by $1000. Debit (increase) Expense """"wedding expenses"""" by $1000. If he paid with a credit card: Credit (increase) Liability """"credit card"""" by $1000. Debit (increase) Expense """"wedding expenses"""" by $1000. When he pays off the credit card: Debit (decrease) Liability """"credit card"""" by $1000. Credit (decrease) Asset """"cash"""" by $1000. (Or more realistically, there are other expenses on the credit card and the amount would be higher.) 3: Issue $3000 in stock to partner company I\'m a little shakier on this, I haven\'t worked with the stock side of accounting. But here\'s my best stab: Well, did you get anything in return? Like did they pay you for the stock? I wouldn\'t think you would just give someone stock as a present. If they paid you cash for the stock: Debit (increase) Asset """"cash"""". Credit (decrease) Capital """"shareholder equity"""". Anyone else want to chime in on that one, I\'m a little shaky there. Here, let me give you the general rules. My boss years ago described it to me this way: You only need to know three things to understand double-entry accounting: 1: There are five types of accounts: Assets: anything you have that has value, like cash, buildings, equipment, and merchandise. Includes things you may not actually have in your hands but that are rightly yours, like money people owe you but haven\'t yet paid. Liabilities: Anything you owe to someone else. Debts, merchandise paid for but not yet delivered, and taxes due. Capital (some call it """"capital"""", others call it """"equity""""): The difference between Assets and Liabilities. The owners investment in the company, retained earnings, etc. Income: Money coming in, the biggest being sales. Expenses: Money going out, like salaries to employees, cost of purchasing merchandise for resale, rent, electric bill, taxes, etc. Okay, that\'s a big """"one thing"""". 2: Every transaction must update two or more accounts. Each update is either a """"debit"""" or a """"credit"""". The total of the debits must equal the total of the credits. 3: A dollar bill in your pocket is a debit. With a little thought (okay, sometimes a lot of thought) you can figure out everything else from there.""'

"Beyond RRSP deductions, how does a high income earner save on taxes?","[""That's not especially high income, and while I can't speak for Canadians,  most of us south of the border just pay the tax. There are tax-advantged retirement savings plans, and charitable donations are often offset by a tax credit, and there are some tax incentives for mortgages, and so on.. but generally the right answer is to just accept that the income tax money was never yours to begin with.""]",The context does not provide any information about how high income earners save on taxes beyond RRSP deductions.,"There are several ways a high income earner can save on taxes beyond RRSP deductions. Some common strategies include:

1. Tax-advantaged investment accounts: High income earners can take advantage of tax-efficient investment accounts such as Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSA) or Registered Education Savings Plans (RESP). These accounts provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, allowing individuals to save on taxes in the long term.

2. Capital gains and dividend income: High income earners can focus on generating income through capital gains and dividend payments, which are typically taxed at lower rates than regular income. By investing in stocks, real estate, or other assets that generate these types of income, individuals can reduce their overall tax burden.

3. Income splitting: High income earners can explore income splitting strategies with their spouse or family members to reduce their overall tax liability. This can involve transferring income to a lower-income spouse, utilizing income splitting loans, or establishing a family trust.

4. Charitable donations: Donating to registered charities can provide high income earners with tax benefits. Charitable donations are eligible for tax credits, which can reduce the amount of taxable income and result in lower taxes owed.

5. Business expenses and deductions: For high income earners who are self-employed or have business income, maximizing business expenses and deductions can help reduce taxable income. This includes deducting eligible business expenses such as home office expenses, travel expenses, and professional fees.

6. Utilizing tax incentives and credits: High income earners should be aware of any available tax incentives and credits that they may qualify for. This can include the Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) tax credit, the Canada Child Benefit, or the Disability Tax Credit, among others.

It is important to note that tax planning should be done in consultation with a tax professional or financial advisor, as individual circumstances may vary.","There are a few ways that high income earners can save on taxes beyond RRSP deductions. Some options include:

1. Tax-Advantaged Retirement Savings Plans: In addition to RRSPs, high income earners may have access to other tax-advantaged retirement savings plans such as a defined benefit pension plan or a deferred compensation plan. These plans allow individuals to contribute pre-tax income, reducing their taxable income in the current year.

2. Charitable Donations: Charitable donations can be used to offset taxable income through tax credits. High income earners may choose to donate to registered charities to reduce their tax liability.

3. Tax Incentives for Mortgages: In some cases, high income earners may be eligible for tax incentives related to mortgages. For example, mortgage interest payments may be deductible, reducing taxable income.

4. Capital Gains Tax: High income earners who are sophisticated investors may choose to invest in assets that generate long-term capital gains. In the US, long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate compared to ordinary income. By holding onto investments and benefiting from capital gains, high income earners can potentially save on taxes.

It's important to note that tax laws and regulations vary by country and can change over time. It's always a good idea to consult with a tax professional or financial advisor to understand the specific options and strategies available to you based on your individual circumstances.","[""That's not especially high income, and while I can't speak for Canadians,  most of us south of the border just pay the tax.

 '""I pay taxes on revenue.  You do have the ability to deduct expenses, though it\'s not as comprehensive as what companies can do: These figures apply to everybody, so those that earn more get taxed more on thee additional income in each bracket (meaning the first $100,000 of taxable income is taxed the same for everybody at one rate, the next $100,000 at a different rate, etc.) So you do get to deduct personal expenses and get taxed on """"profit"""" - but since the vast majority of people don\'t keep detailed records of what they spend, it\'s much simpler just to use blanket deduction amounts for everyone. Companies have much more detailed systems in place to track and categorize expenses, so it\'s easier to just tax on net profit. Plus, the corporate tax rate is much higher than the average individual tax rate - would you trade more deductions for a higher tax rate?""'
 ""There are few things going on here: My advice would be: with 75k income and a regular pay check there isn't a whole let you can do to adjust your tax burden.

Long term capital gains are taxed at 15% in the US, so if you buy and hold on to good companies that reinvest their earnings, then the share price keeps going up and you'll save a lot of money that would go in taxes.  If you're not a very good investor, however, then 401(k)s make a lot of sense. If you're going to end up setting up some asset allocation and buying ETFs and rebalancing or having a  manager rebalance for you every year or so, then you might as well take the 401(k) option and lower your taxable income.  Point #1 is simply wrong, because companies that reinvest earnings and growing for a long time are essentially creating tax-free gains for you, which is even better than tax-deferred gains. Nonetheless, most people have neither the time nor the interest to research companies and for them, the 401(k) makes more sense.""]"

 ""Personally, I have a little checkbook program that I use to keep track of my spending and balance. Like you -- and I presume like most people -- I have certain recurring bills: the mortgage, insurance payments, car payment, etc. I simply enter these into the checkbook program about a month before the bill is due. Then I can run a transaction list that shows the date, amount, and remaining balance after each transaction. So if I want to know how much money I really have available to spend, I just look for the last transaction before my next payday, and see what the balance will be on that day. Personally, I always keep a certain amount of pad in my account so if I made a mistake and entered an incorrect amount for a check, or forgot to enter one completely, I don't overdraw the account. (I like to keep $1000 in such padding but that's way more than really necessary, it's very rare that I make a mistake of more than $100.) In my case, I don't enter electric bills or heating bills because I don't know the amount until I get the bill, and the amounts fall well within my padding, and for just two bills I can factor them in in my head. BTW I wrote this program myself but I'm sure there are similar products on the market. I used to use a spreadsheet and that worked pretty well. (Mainly I wrote the program because I have a tiny side business that I have to keep tax records for even though it makes almost no money.) You could in principle do it on paper, but the catch to that is that when you write payments on your paper ledger in advance of actually writing the check, you will often be writing down payments out of order, and so it becomes difficult to see what your balance is or was or will be on any given date. But a computer system can easily accept transactions out of order and then sort them and re-do the balance calculations in a fraction of a second.""

 ""Funds earned and spent before opening a dedicated business account should be classified according to their origination. For example, if your business received income, where did that money go?  If you took the money personally, it would be considered either a 'distribution' or a 'loan' to you.  It is up to you which of the two options you choose. On the flip side, if your business had an expense that you paid personally, that would be considered either a 'contribution of capital' or a 'loan' from you. If you choose to record these transactions as loans, you can offset them together, so you don't need two separate accounts, loan to you and loan from you. When the bank account was opened, the initial deposit came from where?  If it came from your personal funds, then it is either a 'contribution of capital' or a 'loan' from you. From the sound of your question, you deposited what remained after the preceding income/expenses.  This would, in effect, return the 'loan' account back to zero, if choosing that route. The above would also be how to record any expenses you may pay personally for the business (if any) in the future. Because these transactions were not through a dedicated business bank account, you can't record them in Quickbooks as checks and deposits.  Instead, you can use Journal Entries.  For any income received, you would debit your capital/loan account and credit your income account.  For any expenses, you would debit the appropriate expense account and credit your distribution/loan account. Also, if setting up a loan account, you should choose either Current Asset or Current Liability type.  The capital contribution and distribution account should be Equity type. Hope this helps!""

 ""This kind of questions keeps repeating itself on this site and the answer is generally it doesn't matter. As you said yourself, there are costs either way, and these costs are comparable. Generally, merchant fees differ tremendously between the different kinds of merchants, and while gas stations and video rentals may pay up to 5% and even more, charitable organizations and community services are usually not considered as high fraud risk operation and are charged much lower fees. Either way, paying employees, managing cash/check deposits or paying merchant fees is part of the charity operational expenses. Together with maintaining offices, postal office boxes, office supplies, postage expenses and formal stationary and envelopes needed for physical donations handling.

Home office deductions are a red flag that can trigger audits.","When it comes to writing off part of one's rent for working at home, there are a few important factors to consider. 

Firstly, the individual must determine if they are eligible for this deduction. In general, to qualify for a home office deduction, the space being used for work must be used exclusively and regularly for business purposes. This means that it should be a dedicated area used solely for work and not for personal use.

Secondly, the individual needs to calculate the portion of their rent that can be written off. This is typically done by determining the percentage of the home that is used for business purposes. For example, if the office space accounts for 10% of the total square footage of the home, then 10% of the rent can be deducted.

It is important to note that only certain expenses related to the home office can be deducted, such as a portion of rent, utilities, and maintenance costs. Other personal expenses, such as personal renter's insurance or mortgage interest, cannot be deducted.

Additionally, it is crucial to keep detailed records and documentation to support the deduction. This includes keeping track of rent payments, utility bills, and any other relevant expenses.

Lastly, it is advisable to consult with a tax professional or accountant to ensure compliance with all relevant tax laws and regulations. They can provide guidance and help maximize the allowable deductions while avoiding any potential issues with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).","The ability to write off part of your rent for working at home depends on the tax regulations in your country.

However, it's important to note that the rules and limitations for home office deductions can vary.

Here are a few options:

1. Invest: I could consider investing the money in stocks, bonds, or mutual funds to potentially earn a higher return over time. This could help grow my wealth and provide long-term financial stability.

2. Pay off debt: If I have any outstanding debts, such as student loans or credit card balances, I could use the $100K to pay them off. This would reduce my monthly financial obligations and improve my overall financial health.

3. Save for retirement: I could contribute the $100K to my retirement savings accounts, such as an IRA or 401(k). This would help secure my financial future and allow the money to grow tax-deferred over time.

4. Start a business: If I have an entrepreneurial spirit, I could use the $100K as seed money to start my own business. This would require careful planning and research, but it could potentially lead to financial independence and personal fulfillment.

5. Emergency fund: I could set aside a portion of the $100K as an emergency fund. This would provide a safety net for unexpected expenses or financial hardships that may arise in the future.

Ultimately, the best use of the $100K would depend on my individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. It would be wise to consult with a financial advisor to explore all the options and make an informed decision.","If I had $100,000 in savings, there are a few options I would consider. First, I would make sure I have an emergency fund set aside, typically around 3-6 months of living expenses. This fund would be kept in a high-yield savings account or a money market account for easy access in case of unexpected expenses or job loss.

After establishing the emergency fund, I would look into investing a portion of the money for long-term growth. This could include contributing to a retirement account like a 401(k) or IRA, taking advantage of any employer matching contributions if available. I would also consider diversifying my investments by investing in a mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly real estate or other alternative investments, depending on my risk tolerance and financial goals.

If I have any outstanding high-interest debt, such as credit card debt or personal loans, I would prioritize paying that off to save on interest payments. It's generally a good idea to eliminate high-interest debt before considering other investment options.

Lastly, I might allocate some of the savings towards personal goals or expenses, such as a down payment on a home, further education, or starting a business. It's important to strike a balance between saving for the future and enjoying the present.

Ultimately, the best course of action would depend on individual circumstances, financial goals, and risk tolerance. It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor or planner to create a personalized plan based on your specific situation.","[""Yes, you should be saving for retirement. There are a million ideas out there on how much is a reasonable amount, but I think most advisor would say at least 6 to 10% of your income, which in your case is around $15,000 per year. You give amounts in dollars. Are you in the U.S.? If so, there are at least two very good reasons to put money into a 401k or IRA rather than ordinary savings or investments: (a) Often your employer will make matching contributions. 50% up to 6% of your salary is pretty common, i.e. if you put in 6% they put in 3%. If either of your employers has such a plan, that's an instant 50% profit on your investment. (b) Any profits on money invested in an IRA or 401k are tax free. (Effectively, the mechanics differ depending on the type of account.) So if you put $100,000 into an IRA today and left it there until you retire 30 years later, it would likely earn something like  $600,000 over that time (assuming 7% per year growth). So you'd pay takes on your initial $100,000 but none on the $600,000. With your income you are likely in a high tax bracket, that would make a huge difference. If you're saying that you just can't find a way to put money away for retirement, may I suggest that you cut back on your spending. I understand that the average American family makes about $45,000 per year and somehow manages to live on that. If you were to put 10% of your income toward retirement, then you would be living on the remaining $171,000, which is still almost 4 times what the average family has. Yeah, I make more than $45,000 a year too and there are times when I think, How could anyone possibly live on that? But then I think about what I spend my money on. Did I really need to buy two new computer printers the last couple of months? I certainly could do my own cleaning rather than hiring a cleaning lady to come in twice a month. Etc. A tough decision to make can be paying off debt versus putting money into an investment account. If the likely return on investment is less than the interest rate on the loan, you should certainly concentrate on paying off the loan. But if the reverse is true, then you need to decide between likely returns and risk.""
 ""Determine how much you are going to save first.  Then determine where you can spend your money.  If you're living with your parents, try to build an emergency fund of six months income.  The simplest way is to put half of your income in the emergency fund for a year.   Try to save at least 10% of your income for retirement.  The earlier you start this, the longer you'll have to let the magic of compounding work on it.  If your employer offers a 401k with a match, do that first.  If not, consider an IRA.  You probably want to do a Roth now (because you probably pay little in taxes so the deduction from a standard IRA won't help you).   After the year, you'll have an emergency fund.  Work out how much money you'll need for rent, utilities, and groceries when you're on your own.  Invest that in some way.  Pay off student loans if you have any.  Buy a car that you can keep a long time if you need one.  Go to night school.  Put any excess money in a savings account or mutual fund.  This is money for doing things related to housing.  Perhaps you'll need to buy a washer/dryer.  Or pay a down payment on a mortgage eventually.   Saving this money now does two things:  first, it gives you savings for when you need it; second, it keeps you from getting used to spending your entire paycheck.  If you are used to only having $200 of spending cash out of each check, you will fit your spending into that.  If you are used to spending $800 every two weeks, it will be hard to cut your spending to make room for rent, etc.""
 ""You have great intentions, and a great future. As far as investing goes, you're a bit early. Unless your parents or other benefactor is going to pay every dime of your expenses, you'll have costs you need to address. $1000 is the start of a nice emergency fund, but not yet enough to consider investing for the long term. If you continue to work, it's not tough to burn through $200/wk especially when you are in college and have more financial responsibility.""
 ""First, what's the reason? Why do you have that much in cash at all - are you concerned about market volatility, are you planning to buy a house, do you have tens of millions of dollars and this is your slush fund?  Are you a house flipper and this is part of business for you? If you need the money for short term use - ie, you're buying a house in cash next month - then as long as you're in a sound bank (one of the big national ones, for example) it seems reasonable.  You can never predict a crash like 2008, but it seems unlikely that Chase or Citibank will go under in the next few weeks. If you like to have a cash position, then split the money among multiple banks.  Buy a CD at one major bank with some of the amount.  My in-laws have a trust which is partially invested in CDs, and they use multiple banks for this purpose to keep their accounts fully insured.  Each separate bank you're covered up to 250k, so if you have $150k at Chase and $150k at a local bank, you're covered.  (You're also covered in a much larger amount - up to 1MM potentially - if you are married, as you can have a separate account each for $250k and a joint account up to $500k.) Otherwise, why do you have that much in cash?  You should invest it in something that will return more than inflation, at a minimum... Edit post-clarifications: $350k is around my level of 'Maybe, maybe not'.  You're risking $100k on a pretty low risk (assuming this isn't a small local bank, and even those are pretty low still).  In order to remove that risk you have to do something active - ie, take 100k somewhere else, open a new bank account, etc. - which isn't exactly the hardest thing in the world, but it does take effort.  Is it worth the 0.001% chance (entirely made up) you lose the 100k?  That's $10, if you agree with that risk chance.  Up to you. It wouldn't be particularly hard, though, to open an account with an online bank, deposit $100k in there in a 6 month CD, then pay the IRS from your other account and when the 6 month CD expires take the cash back into your active account.  Assuming you're not planning on buying a house in the next six months this should be fine, I'd think (and even then you'd still have $150k for the downpayment up front, which is enough to buy a $750k house w/o PMI). Additionally, as several commenters note: if you can reasonably do so, and your money won't be making significant interest, you might choose to pay your taxes now rather than later.  This removes the risk entirely; the likely small interest you earn over 3 months may be similar to the amount you'd spend (mostly of your time, plus possibly actual expenses) moving it to another bank.  If you're making 2% or 3% this may not be true, but if you're in a 0.25% account like my accounts are, $100k * 0.25% * 0.25 is $62.50, after all.""]"
What are “upstream investments” and “downstream investments” in this context?,"['Upstream is into businesses that supply the original business; downstream is into businesses that make use of the original product.  So in that description, what they are saying is that the original business received products from plantations and sent products to manufacturing. This is also called vertical integration.  Meaning that they are diversifying along their supply chain so that they control more of it.  This is in contrast with horizontal integration, where they move into new products that either compete with the existing products or which are entirely separate.   In general, the upside of vertical integration is that a company is less reliant on suppliers (and intermediate consumers) and has more control over its supply chain.  The downside is that they have less opportunity to partner with other companies in the same supply chain, as they compete with them.  Some companies are better at managing to do both.  For example, Amazon.com has integrated fulfillment and sales.  But partners can still do their own fulfillment and/or sales, choosing how much to send out to Amazon.   If you are investing in individual stocks, integrated companies can be problematic in that they cut across diversification areas.  So they can be harder to balance with other stocks.  You can either buy plantations, transport, and manufacturing together or not buy at all.  If your investment strategy says to increase plantations and reduce manufacturing, this can be difficult to implement with an integrated company.  Of course, everyone else has the same problem, which can lead to integrated companies being undervalued.  So they may be an opportunity as a value stock.']","""Upstream investments"" refer to investments in businesses that supply the original business, such as plantations that provide raw materials.

""Downstream investments"" refer to investments in businesses that make use of the original product, such as manufacturing companies that process the raw materials into finished products.","In this context, ""upstream investments"" refer to investments made in companies or activities that are situated earlier in the supply chain or production process. This could include investments in raw material suppliers, manufacturers, or other businesses that are involved in the production of goods or services.

On the other hand, ""downstream investments"" refer to investments made in companies or activities that are situated later in the supply chain or production process. This could include investments in distributors, wholesalers, retailers, or other businesses that are involved in the distribution or sale of goods or services.","Based on the given context, there is no mention of ""upstream investments"" or ""downstream investments."" Therefore, I don't have enough information to provide an answer to your question.","['""So you\'re basically saying that average market fluctuations have an affect on individual stocks, because individual stocks are often priced in relation to the growth of the market as a whole?

 '""1) When it says """"an investment or mutual fund"""", is a mutual fund not   an investment? If no, what is the definition of an investment? A mutual fund is indeed an investment. The article probably mentions  mutual funds separately from other investments because it is not uncommon for mutual funds to give you the option to automatically reinvest dividends and capital gains.    2) When it says """"In terms of stocks"""", why does it only mention   distribution of dividends but not distribution of capital gains? Since distributions are received as cash deposits they can be used to buy more of the stock. Capital gains, on the other hand, occur when an asset increases in value. These gains are realized when the asset is sold. In the case of stocks, reinvestment of capital gains doesn\'t make much sense since buying more stock after selling it to realize capital gains results in you owning as much stock as you had before you realized the gains. 3) When it says """"In terms of mutual funds"""", it says about """"the   reinvestment of distributions and dividends"""". Does """"distributions"""" not   include distributions of """"dividends""""? why does it mention   """"distributions"""" parallel to """"dividends""""? Used in this setting, dividend and distribution are synonymous, which is highlighted by the way they are used in parallel. 4) Does reinvestment only apply to interest or dividends, but not to   capital gain? Reinvestment only applies to dividends in the case of stocks. Mutual funds must distribute capital gains to shareholders, making these distributions essentially cash dividends, usually as a special end of year distribution. If you\'ve requested automatic reinvestment, the fund will buy more shares with these capital gain distributions as well.""'
 'The risk of the particular share moving up or down is same for both.   however in terms of mitigating the risk, Investor A is conservative on upside, ie will exit if he gets 10%, while is ready to take unlimited downside ... his belief is that things will not go worse ..

 ""To me this sounds like a transaction, where E already owns a company worth 400k and can therefore pocket the money from D and give D 25% of the profits every year. There is nothing objective (like a piece of paper) that states the company is worth 400K. It is all about perceived value. Some investors may think it is worth something because of some knowledge they may have. Heck, the company could be worth nothing but the investor could have some sentimental value associated to it. So is it actually the case that E's company is worth 400k only AFTER the transaction? It is worth what someone pays for it when they pay for it. I repeat- the 400K valuation is subjective. In return the investor is getting 25% ownership of the product or company. The idea is that when someone has ownership, they have a vested interest in it being successful. In that case, the investor will do whatever he/she can to improve the chances of success (in addition to supplying the 100K capital). For instance, the investor will leverage their network or perhaps put more money into it in the future. Is the 100k added to the balance sheet as cash? Perhaps. It is an asset that may later be used to fund inventory (for instance). ... and would the other 300k be listed as an IP asset? No. See what I said about the valuation just being perception. Note that the above analysis doesn't apply to all Dragons Den deals. It only applies to situations where capital is exchanged for ownership in the form of equity.""]"
What options are available for a home loan with poor credit but a good rental history?,"[""Why not just do an FHA loan? The minimum credit score is 580, and you can sometimes even go lower than that.

 ""Here are some (not all) things that can help overcome a low credit score: Getting a new job may actually hurt unless it's a substantial increase in income.  Banks usually look at salary going back 2 years, and look for consistent, maintainable income.  If you just got a new job that pays more, the bank may conservatively assume that it may not last.""

These options include:

1. FHA Loans: The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) offers loans specifically designed for individuals with lower credit scores. These loans have more flexible credit requirements and lower down payment options.

2. VA Loans: If you are a veteran or an active-duty member of the military, you may be eligible for a VA loan. These loans are guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs and often have more lenient credit requirements.

3. USDA Loans: The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) offers loans for individuals purchasing homes in rural areas. These loans have low credit score requirements and offer 100% financing options.

4. Subprime Loans: Subprime lenders specialize in providing loans to individuals with poor credit. However, these loans often come with higher interest rates and fees, so it's important to carefully consider the terms before proceeding.

5. Improve Credit Score: It may be beneficial to work on improving your credit score before applying for a home loan. This can be done by paying bills on time, reducing debt, and correcting any errors on your credit report.

It is recommended to consult with a mortgage lender or a financial advisor to explore these options further and determine the best course of action based on your specific financial situation.","Some options that may be available for a home loan with poor credit but a good rental history include:

1. FHA Loan: The minimum credit score requirement for an FHA loan is 580, and sometimes even lower. This could be an option to consider.

2. Rent-to-Own Agreement: You could explore the possibility of a rent-to-own agreement with your landlord. This would allow you to continue renting the property with the option to buy it in the future.

3. Saving a large down payment: If you have a good income, you could focus on saving a large down payment. Having a substantial down payment, typically around 25%, and a history of recently saving that amount could increase your chances of getting a mortgage.

4. Local banks and REO properties: Consider approaching local banks that don't just write mortgages and sell them. Inquire about REO (real estate owned by the bank) properties, as they may be more willing to work with you and offer financing options.

5. Private lenders and mortgage investment clubs: Explore the possibility of getting financing from private lenders, such as individuals you find at mortgage investment clubs or religious institutions. Shopping around may help you find lower interest rates.

 ""With bad credit but good income, I would simply save a large down payment. You're much more likely to get a mortgage with 25% down and a history of recently saving that 25% to show.""
 ""No, it is never impossible to get credit so long as there are no price controls or quotas. In most of the United States, the impetus for housing is so strong that it's one sector of credit that has nearly no price regulation, price in this case being interest rates. Corporate banks will not touch you now because Dodd-Frank now makes them liable to you and investors if you default on the mortgage.  Also, Fannie & Freddie, who ultimately finance most mortgages in the US now require banks to buy back loans if they fail, so banks are only financing the most creditworthy. All is not lost because markets are like rivers if not fully dammed: they find a way through. In your case, you can get a fully-financed mortgage if you're willing to pay interest rates probably double what you could otherwise get in the market with good credit. If the foreclosure process is quick and benefits the lender more in your state, the interest rate will be even lower. Your creditors will most likely be individuals you find at mortgage investment clubs and religious institutions.  If you shop around, you'll be surprised at how low a rate you might get. Also, since the cost of your prospective home is so low, it's very easy for an investor flush with cash and few investments to take a flier on a mother committed to her children who only needs $50,000. The FHA has been vastly expanded, and since your individual credit is clean, there may be a chance to get financing through it, but be prepared for red tape.""
 ""First step, pull a copy of your credit report, and score. You should monitor that score and do what you can to bring it up. Your chances are far better if (a) you first save a sizable downpayment, and (b) go with a local bank that doesn't just write the mortgage and sell it. Better still, go to that local bank and inquire about REO (real estate owned by the bank) property. These are properties they foreclosed on and depending how they are carrying them, you might find decent opportunities. As a matter of logic, a local bank that owns these specific properties (as compared to debt pools where big banks have piles of paper owned fractionally) are more willing to get a new owner in and paying a new loan.  Congrats on the new, higher, income. I'd suggest you first build the emergency fund before the downpayment fund. Let us know how it goes.""]"

The poster cannot take deductions or losses relating to this activity.,"As an AI language model, I can provide general information about taxes for hobbyist group buys. However, please note that tax laws and regulations vary by jurisdiction, so it is always advisable to consult with a tax professional or local tax authority to ensure accurate and up-to-date information for your specific situation.

In general, hobbyist group buys may have tax implications depending on the nature and scale of the activities involved. Here are a few key points to consider:

1. Classification: Determine whether the group buy is considered a hobby or a business. The distinction is important because different tax rules may apply. Generally, if the group buy is conducted for personal enjoyment or as a social activity without a profit motive, it may be considered a hobby. However, if there is an intention to make a profit, it could be viewed as a business.

2. Sales Tax: If the group buy involves the sale of goods or services, sales tax may be applicable. The specific rules regarding sales tax vary by jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions may exempt hobbyists from collecting sales tax below a certain threshold, while others may require sales tax to be collected regardless of the hobbyist status.

3. Income Tax: If the group buy is considered a business activity and generates income, hobbyists may be required to report and pay taxes on any profits. Income tax laws will vary depending on the jurisdiction, and hobbyists may need to keep track of their expenses and report the income earned from the group buy.

4. Deductible Expenses: If the group buy is considered a business, hobbyists may be able to deduct certain expenses related to the activity, such as advertising costs, packaging materials, or shipping expenses. However, the deductibility of expenses will depend on the specific tax laws and regulations in the jurisdiction.

To ensure compliance with tax laws, it is recommended to consult with a tax professional who can provide guidance based on the specific jurisdiction and circumstances involved in the hobbyist group buy.","If you are participating in a hobbyist group buy, the income you receive from the group members should be reported as nonbusiness income on Line 21 of Form 1040. You would not be able to deduct any expenses related to organizing the group buy on your tax return. However, if the group buy is considered a business and not just a hobby, you would need to report the income and expenses on a Schedule C attached to your tax return. It is important to consult with a tax professional to determine the appropriate treatment of your group buy income and to ensure compliance with tax laws.","['""If this is truly hobby income (you do not intend to operate as a business and don\'t have a profit motive) then report the income on Line 21 (""""other income"""") of form 1040.  If this is a business, then the income and expenses belong on a Schedule C to form 1040. The distinction is in the treatment of profits and losses - your net profits on a business are subject to self-employment tax, while hobby income is not. Net losses on a business are deductible against other income; net losses on a hobby are miscellaneous itemized deductions in the """"2%"""" box on Schedule A.  From a tax point of view, selling apps and accepting donations are different. Arguably, donations are gifts; gifts are not taxable income.  The hobby/business and income/gift distinctions are tricky. If the dollar amounts are small, nobody (including the IRS) really cares. If you start making or losing a lot of money, you\'ll want to get a good tax person lined up who can help you decide how to characterize these items of income and expens, how to put them on your return, and how to defend the return on audit if necessary.""'
 '""If you have income - it should appear on your tax return. If you are a non-resident, that would be 1040NR, with the eBay income appearing on line 21. Since this is unrelated to your studies, this income will not be covered by the tax treaties for most countries, and you\'ll pay full taxes on it. Keep in mind that the IRS may decide that you\'re actually having a business, in which case you\'ll be required to attach Schedule C to your tax return and maybe pay additional taxes (mainly self-employment). Also, the USCIS may decide that you\'re actually having a business, regardless of how the IRS sees it, in which case you may have issues with your green card. For low income from occasional sales, you shouldn\'t have any issues. But if it is something systematic that you spend significant time on and earn significant amounts of money - you may get into trouble.

 ""I assume US as mhoran_psprep edited, although I'm not sure IRS necessarily means US. (It definitely used to also include Britain's Inland Revenue, but they changed.)  (US) Stockbrokers do not normally withhold on either dividends/interest/distributions or realized capital gains, especially since gains might be reduced or eliminated by later losses. (They can be required to apply backup withholding to dividends and interest; don't ask how I know :-) You are normally required to pay most of your tax during the year, defined as within 10% or $1000 whichever is more, by withholding and/or estimated payments. Thus if the tax on your income including your recent gain will exceed your withholding by 10% and $1000, you should either adjust your withholding or make an estimated payment or some combination, although even if you have a job the last week of December is too late for you to adjust withholding significantly, or even to make a timely estimated payment if 'earlier in the year' means in an earlier quarter as defined for tax (Jan-Mar, Apr-May, June-Aug, Sept-Dec). See https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estimated-taxes and for details its link to Publication 505. But a 'safe harbor' may apply since you say this is your first time to have capital gains. If you did not owe any income tax for last year (and were a citizen or resident), or (except very high earners) if you did owe tax and your withholding plus estimated payments this year is enough to pay last year's tax, you are exempt from the Form 2210 penalty and you have until the filing deadline (normally April 15 but this year April 18 due to weekend and holiday) to pay. The latter is likely if your job and therefore payroll income and withholding this year was the same or nearly the same as last year and there was no other big change other than the new capital gain. Also note that gains on investments held more than one year are classified as long-term and taxed at lower rates, which reduces the tax you will owe (all else equal) and thus the payments you need to make. But your wording 'bought and sold ... earlier this year' suggests your holding was not long-term, and short-term gains are taxed as 'ordinary' income. Added: if the state you live in has a state income tax similar considerations apply but to smaller amounts. TTBOMK all states tax capital gains (and other investment income, other than interest on exempt bonds), and don't necessarily give the lower rates for long-term gains. And all states I have lived in have 'must have withholding or estimated payments' rules generally similar to the Federal ones, though not identical.""]"
Will the ex-homeowner still owe money after a foreclosure?,"[""Yes, the borrower is responsible for paying back the full amount of the loan. Foreclosure gives the bank possession of the property, which they can (and do) sell. Any shortfall is still the borrower's responsibility.

 ""It is in the bank's interest to sell the property for as much as they can (although it is doubtful they will put as much effort/time into selling it as the owner might). They will certainly not sell it for $1. The main reason for this is that the bank would prefer to own $100k, than a loan to them from a customer for $100k. Banks have to discount the value of loans to take into account the likelihood of the loan not being repaid. They classify certain loans as riskier than others, and these are discounted more heavily.

Foreclosure gives the bank possession of the property, which they can (and do) sell. Any shortfall is still the borrower's responsibility. But, no, the bank can't sell the property for a dollar; they have to make a reasonable effort. Usually the sale is done through a sheriff's sale, that is, a more or less carefully supervised auction. Bankruptcy will wipe out the shortfall, and most other debts, but the downside is that most of the rest of your assets will also be sold to help pay off what you owe. Details of what you can keep vary from state to state. If you want to go this route, hire a lawyer.""
 ""For insight on what will happen, I suggest looking at the situation from the lender's perspective: If your setbacks are temporary, and you are likely to get back on your feet again, they will protect their investment by making accommodations, and probably charging you extra fees along the way. If your financial hardship seems irredeemable, they probably try to squeeze you for as much as possible, and then eventually take your house, protecting their investment as best they can. If they are going to foreclose, they may be reluctant to do it quickly, as foreclosure is expensive, takes man power, and looks bad on their books.  So it may get pushed off for a Quarter, or a fiscal year. But if you are asking if they'll help you out from the goodness of their heart, well, a bank has no heart, and creditors are interested in ROI.  They'll take the easiest path to profit, or failing that, the path to minimum financial losses.   The personal consequences to you are not their concern. Once you realize this, it may change your thinking about your own situation.   If you think you have a path to financial recovery, then you need to make that clear to them, in writing, with details.  Make a business case that working with you is in their own best interests. If you cannot make such a case, recognize that they'll likely squeeze you for as much as possible in penalties, fees, interest payments, etc, before eventually foreclosing on you anyway.  Don't play that game. If your home is a lost cause financially, plan how to get out from it with the smallest losses possible.  Don't pay more than you need to, and don't throw good money after bad.""
 ""What are the risks, if any The risks are exemplified by the outcomes presented on this website, including: There's a chance you will end up paying large mortgage payments on a house occupied by an ex-friend and paying large amounts of money to lawyers to try and get things straightened out.

"Can saving/investing 15% of your income starting age 25, likely make you a millionaire?","[""Yes, quite easily, in fact.  You left a lot of numbers out, so lets start with some assumptions. If you are at the median of middle income families in the US that might mean $70,000/year. 15% of that is an investment of $875 per month. If you invest that amount monthly and assume a 6% return, then you will have a million dollars at approximately 57 years old. 6% is a very conservative number, and as Ben Miller points out, the S&P 500 has historically returned closer to 11%. If you assumed an aggressive 9% return, and continued with that $875/month for 40 years until you turn 65, that becomes $4 million. Start with a much more conservative $9/hr for $18,720 per year (40 hours * 52 weeks, no overtime). If that person saved 14% of his/her income or about $219 per month from 25 to 65 years old with the same 9%, they would still achieve $1 million for retirement. Is it much harder for a poor person? Certainly, but hopefully these numbers illustrate that it is better to save and invest even a small amount if that's all that can be done. High income earners have the most to gain if they save and the most to lose if they don't. Let's just assume an even $100,000/year salary and modest 401(k) match of 3%. Even married filing jointly a good portion of that salary is going to be taxed at the 25% rate. If single you'll be hitting the 28% income tax rate.  If you can max out the $18,000 (2017) contribution limit and get an additional $3,000 from an employer match (for a total monthly contribution of $1750) 40 years of contributions would become $8.2 million with the 9% rate of return.  If you withdrew that money at 4% per year you would have a residual income of $300k throughout your retirement.""
 ""It depends on how much you save, how much your savings earns each year.  You can model it with a very simple spreadsheet:  Formula view:  You can change this simple model with any other assumptions you wish to make and model. This spreadsheet presumes that you only make $50,000/year, never get a raise, that your savings earns 6% per year and that the market never has a crash like 2008. The article never states the assumptions that the author has made, and therefore we can't honestly determine how truthful the author is.  I recommend the book Engineering Your Retirement as it has more detailed models and goes into more details about what you should expect. I wrote a slightly more detailed post that showed a spreadsheet that is basically what I use at home to track my retirement savings.""
 ""Millionaire, Shmillionaire! Let's do this calculation Bruno Mars style (I wanna be a Billionaire...) If my calculations are correct, in the above scenario, at age 80, you would have more than a billion in the bank, after taxes.""
 ""Yes, becoming a millionaire is a reasonable goal.  Saving 15% of your income starting at age 25 and investing in the stock market will likely get you there. The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of the S&P 500 over the last 35 years has been about 11%. (That 35 years includes at least two fairly serious crashes.) You may get more or less than that number in the future, but let's guess that you'll average 9%. Let's say that you begin with nothing invested, and you start investing $100 per week at age 25. (If your annual income is $35,000, that is about 15% of your income.)  You decide to invest your money in an S&P 500 index mutual fund. 35 years from now when you are 60 years old, you would be a millionaire ($1.2 Million, actually). You may earn less than the assumed 9%, depending on how the stock market does.  However, if you stick with your 15% investment amount throughout your whole career, you'll most likely end up with more, because your income will probably increase during your career.  And you will probably be working past age 60, giving your investments time to earn even more.""
 ""I'll offer another answer, using different figures. Let's assume 6% is the rate of return you can expect.  You are age 25, and plan to retire at age 65.  If you have $0 and want $1M at retirement, you will need to put away $524.20/month, or $6,290.40/year, which is 15% of $41,936.  So $41,936 is what you'd need to make per year in order to get to your target. You can calculate your own figures with a financial calculator:  480 months as your term (or, adjust this to your time horizon in months), .486755% as your interest (or, take your assumed interest rate + 1 to the 1/12th power and subtract 1 to convert to a monthly interest rate), 0 as your PV, and $1M as your FV; then solve for PMT.""
 ""I see a lot of answers calculcating with incomes that are much higher than yours, here is something for your situation: If you would keep your current income for the rest of your life, here is approximately how things would turn out after 40 years: All interest is calculated relative to the amount in your portfolio. Therefore, lets start with 1 dollar for 40 years: With your current income, 15% would be 82.5 dollar. At 12% this would over 40 years get you almost 1 million dollar. I would call a required return of more than 12% not 'likely'. The good news, is that your income will likely increase, and especially if this happens fast things will start to look up.  The bad news is, that your current salary is quite low. So, it basically means that you need to make some big jumps in the next few years in order to make this scenario likely. If you can quickly move your salary towards ranges that are more common in the US, then 15% of your income can build up to a million before you retire. However, if you just follow gradual growth, you would need to get quite lucky to reach a million.  Note that even if reaching a million appears unlikely, it is probably still a good idea to save!""
 'The article links to William Bernstein’s plan that he outlined for Business Insider, which says: Modelling this investment strategy Picking three funds from Google and running some numbers. The international stock index only goes back to April 29th 1996, so a run of 21 years was modelled.  Based on 15% of a salary of $550 per month with various annual raises: Broadly speaking, this investment doubles the value of the contributions over two decades. Note:  Rebalancing fees are not included in the simulation. Below is the code used to run the simulation.  If you have Mathematica you can try with different funds.    Notice above how the bond index (VBMFX) preserves value during the 2008 crash.  This illustrates the rationale for diversifying across different fund types.'
 ""As others have shown, if you assume that you can get 6% and you invest 15% of a reasonable US salary then you can hit 1 million by the time you retire. If you invest in property in a market like the UK (where I come from...) then insane house price inflation will do it for you as well. In 1968 my parents bought a house for £8000. They had a mortgage on it for about 75% of the value. They don't live there but that house is now valued at about £750,000. Okay, that's close to 60 years, but with a 55 year working life that's not so unreasonable. If you assume the property market (or the shares market) can go on rising forever... then invest in as much property as you can with your 15% as mortgage payments... and watch the million roll in. Of course, you've also got rent on your property portfolio as well in the intervening years. However, take the long view. Inflation will hit what a million is worth. In 1968, a million was a ridiculously huge amount of money. Now it's 'Pah, so what, real rich people have billions'. You'll get your million and it will not be enough to retire comfortably on! In 1968 my parents salaries as skilled people were about £2000 a year... equivalent jobs now pay closer to £50,000... 25x salary inflation in the time. Do that again, skilled professional salary in 60 years of £125000 a year... so your million is actually 4 years salary.  Not being relentlessly negative... just suggesting that a financial target like 'own a million (dollars)' isn't a good strategy. 'Own something that yields a decent amount of money' is a better one.""
 '""Other people have already demonstrated the effect of compound interest to the question. I\'d like to add a totally different perspective.  Note that the article says if you can follow this simple recipe throughout your working career, you will almost certainly beat out most professional investors [...] you\'ll likely accumulate enough savings to retire comfortably. (the latter point may be the more practical mark than the somewhat arbitrary million (rupees? dollars?) My point here is that the group of people who do put away a substantial fraction of their (lower) early wages and keep them invested for decades show (at least) two traits that will make a very substantial difference to the average (western) person. They may be correlated, though: people who are not tempted or able to resist the temptation to spend (almost) their whole income may be more likely to not touch their savings or investments. (In my country, people like to see themselves as """"world champions in savings"""", but if you talk to people you find that many people talk about saving for the next holidays [as opposed to saving for retirement].) Also, if you get going this way long before you are able to retire you reach a relative level of independence that can give you a much better position in wage negotiations as you do not need to take the first badly paid job that comes along in order to survive but can afford to wait and look and negotiate for a better job.  Psychologically, it also seems to be easier to consistently keep the increase in your spending below the increase of your income than to reduce spending once you overspent. There are studies around that find homeowners on average substantially more wealthy than people who keep living in rental appartments (I\'m mostly talking Germany, were renting is normal and does not imply poverty - but similar findings have also been described for the US) even though someone who\'d take the additional money the homeowner put into their home over the rent and invested in other ways would have yielded more value than the home. The difference is largely attributed to the fact that buying and downpaying a home enforces low spending and saving, and it is found that after some decades of downpayment homeowners often go on to spend less than their socio-economic peers who rent. The group that is described in this question is one that does not even need the mental help of enforcing the savings. In addition, if this is not about the fixed million but about reaching a level of wealth that allows you to retire: people who have practised moderate spending habits as adults for decades are typically also much better able to get along with less in retirement than others who did went with a high consumption lifestyle instead (e.g. the homeowners again).  My estimate is that these effects compound in a way that is much more important than the """"usual"""" compounding effect of interest - and even more if you look at interest vs. inflation, i.e. the buying power of your investment for everyday life.  Note that they also cause the group in question to be more resilient in case of a market crash than the average person with about no savings (note that market crashes lead to increased risk of job loss).  Slightly off topic: I do not know enough how difficult saving 50 USD out of 50 USD in Pakistan is - and thus cannot comment whether the savings effort called for in the paper is equivalent/higher/lower than what you achieve. I find that trying to keep to student life (i.e. spending that is within the means of a student) for the first professional years can help kick-starting a nest egg (European experience - again, not sure whether applicable in Pakistan).""'
 ""If by being a millionaire you mean dollar millionaire then I doubt that it is really that easy in Pakistani context. At present the exchange rate is 107 Pakistani rupees per US dollar so even with this exchange rate, to have a million US dollars means having 107 million rupees of wealth. Now with this maths in mind you can very well calculate how much possible it is for an average 25 years old Pakistani to have that much wealth. And by the time you have 107 million Pakistani rupees of wealth the exchange rate against the US dollar would have only gone up against Pakistani currency. That article which you have mentioned makes calculations in US context and dollar terms. However if you talk only in terms of your country's context then being a millionaire means having 1 million rupees of wealth and that is something which is quite achievable with your salary and within very short span of time.""
 'The really simple answer is that compound interest is compound not linear.  Money invested for longer earns more interest, and the sooner you start investing, the longer it has to earn interest.  These ideas come out of pension investment where 65 is the usual retirement age and what you invest in the 1st ten years of your pension (or any other compound interest fund) accounts for over 50% of what you will get out. 25 to 65 is forty years and $100 invested at 7% for 40 years is $1400.  $100 invested every year for 40 years the pot would be worth just under $20,000. At 30 years, it would be worth under $10,000, and at 20 years it would be worth only $4099.  If you double your investment amount every 10 years you would have invested $15700, and the pot would be worth $45,457. Do exactly the same but starting at 35 instead of 25 and your pot would only be worth $14,200.'

Ditto allowing them to do a pay run on your account - they can make a mistake and you'll have difficulty proving it.  A payment via my bank account gives me an electronic record and I can ensure all the details are correct myself. In addition, in the UK, paying online gives you a good few months extra grace to pay.  Even in South Africa, online payments are given a few weeks grace over physical payments.  Their recognising that you paying electronically saves them processing time.""]"
Income Tax and Investments,"[""The $50k is subject to the appropriate income taxes, which may include FICA taxes including the employer share if you are self employed. The after tax money can then be invested with the amount invested being the cost basis (I.e., if you invest $40k you will have a cost basis of $40k).  In future years you will have taxes due if any of those investments pay dividends (or capital gain distributions). Once you sell you will have a capital gain or loss that you will pay taxes on (or take a deduction if a loss). Now you can improve this picture if you are able to put some of your money into a retirement account (either a tax deductible or a ROTH).

If you use a tax deferred account your tax is higher but that is because you were also investing Uncle Sam's portion of your pay check.""
 'Unless you make those investments inside a tax-deferred account, you will have to pay income-taxes on that money this year. Because you made that money through your own business, you will also have payroll taxes due on that money this year.']","The $50k is subject to income taxes, including FICA taxes if you are self-employed. The after-tax money can be invested with the amount invested being the cost basis. Taxes may be due on dividends or capital gain distributions from those investments in future years. When selling, there will be taxes on capital gains or deductions for losses. Putting money into a retirement account can improve the tax situation, as capital gains and dividends are not taxed in retirement accounts. If money is not invested in a tax-deferred account, income taxes will need to be paid this year. Payroll taxes are also due on money earned through a business.","Income tax and investments are closely related because investment income is typically subject to taxation. When individuals earn income from their investments, such as dividends, interest, or capital gains, they are required to report and pay taxes on these earnings to the government. The specific tax implications of investments depend on various factors, such as the type of investment, the holding period, and the individual's tax bracket. Additionally, certain investment vehicles, such as retirement accounts or tax-exempt bonds, may offer tax advantages or deferrals. It is important for investors to understand the tax implications of their investments and consult with a tax professional to optimize their tax strategies and minimize their tax liabilities.","Income tax is a tax that individuals and businesses are required to pay on their income. This includes wages, salaries, and profits from investments. When it comes to investments, the tax treatment depends on the type of investment and the duration of holding.

For long-term investments, such as stocks or real estate, the gains are typically taxed at a lower rate called the long-term capital gains rate. This is done to encourage long-term investments and to account for the fact that the income used for investment has already been taxed once before. The long-term capital gains rate is often lower than the ordinary income tax rate.

Dividends received from investments are also subject to taxation. Qualified dividends, which meet certain criteria, are taxed at the same rate as long-term capital gains. Non-qualified dividends are taxed at the individual's ordinary income tax rate.

It's important to note that there may be additional taxes, such as the Net Investment Income Tax, for higher-income individuals. This tax applies to investment income and is separate from the regular income tax.

To optimize tax efficiency, individuals can consider investing in retirement accounts, such as traditional IRAs or Roth IRAs. Contributions to these accounts may be tax-deductible or tax-free, and the investment gains and dividends within the account are not subject to immediate taxation.

Overall, the tax implications of investments can be complex, and it's advisable to consult with a tax professional or financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.","['If you receive dividends on an investment, those are taxed.'
 '""Long-term capital gains, which is often the main element of investment income for investors who are not high-frequency day traders, are taxed at a single rate that is often substantially below the marginal rate they would otherwise be taxed at, particularly for wealthy individuals. There are a few rationales behind this treatment; the two most common are that the government wants to encourage long-term investments (as opposed to short-term speculation), and that capital gains are a kind of double taxation (from one point of view) as they are coming from income that has already been taxed once before (as wage or ordinary income).  The latter in particular is highly controversial, but this is one of the more divisive political issues in the taxation front - one party would eliminate the tax entirely, the other would eliminate the difference. For most individuals, the majority of their long-term capital gains are taxed at 15% up to almost half of a million dollars total AGI, which is a fairly low rate - it\'s equivalent to the rate a taxpayer would pay on up to $37,000 in wage income (after deductions/exemptions/etc.).  You can see from this table in Wikipedia that it is much preferred to pay long-term capital gains rates when possible - at every point it\'s at least 10% lower than the tax rate for ordinary income. Ordinary income includes wages and many other sources of income - basically, anything that is not long term capital gains. Wage income is taxed at this rate, and also subject to some non-income-tax taxes (FICA and Medicare in particular); other sources of ordinary income are not subject to those taxes (including IRA income).  Short term capital gains are generally included in this bucket. Qualified Dividends are treated similarly to long-term capital gains (as they are of a similar nature), and taxed accordingly. The """"Net Investment Tax"""" is basically applying the Medicare tax to investment income for higher-income taxpayers ($125k single, $250k joint).  It\'s on top of capital gains rates for them.  It came about through the Affordable Care Act, and is one of the first provisions likely to be repealed by the new Congress (as it can be repealed through the budgeting provision).  It seems likely that 2017 taxes will not contain this provision.""'

To account for this, you would debit the cash account for the actual expenses incurred and credit the liability account for the excess reimbursement. This ensures that the company's financial statements accurately reflect the true expenses and liabilities. Additionally, it is important to properly document and track the excess reimbursement to ensure it is returned in a timely manner.","If the reimbursements exceed the actual expenses, you would need to record the excess amount as income. Here's an example of how you could account for it:

1. Record the initial expense:

   Credit: Cash or Bank Account - $90

2. Receive the reimbursement:
   Debit: Cash or Bank Account - $100
   Credit: Reimbursement Income Account - $100

In this example, the $90 expense is covered by the reimbursement, and the additional $10 is recorded as income.

I would recommend a solution that reduces duplication as much as possible- and depending on what information you\'re interested in tracking you could set it up in very different ways.

Thus, when you do an expense report, you can limit on the """"his"""" or """"hers"""" asset accounts, and see only the expenses which pertain to those accounts (likewise for liabilities/credit cards). If, on the other hand, you\'re more interested in a running sum of expenses- rather than create """"Me"""" and """"Spouse"""" accounts at every leaf of the expense tree, it would make much more sense to create top level accounts for Expenses:His:etc and Expenses:Hers:etc.  Using this model, you could create only the sub expense accounts that apply for each of your spending (with matching account structures for common accounts).""'

However, it is important to note that not making as much money as is easily possible is not the same as losing money.","The average investor can lose money in several ways. One common reason is making poor investment decisions based on emotions, such as buying when the market is at its peak and selling when it is at its lowest point. Timing the market is extremely difficult, and many investors end up buying high and selling low, resulting in losses.

Another reason is lack of diversification. If an investor puts all their money into a single stock or a few investments, they are exposed to higher risks. If that particular investment performs poorly, they can suffer significant losses. Diversification helps spread the risk across different asset classes and reduces the impact of one investment's poor performance.

Additionally, lack of knowledge and understanding of the investment market can lead to losses. Investing without a clear strategy or without proper research can result in poor investment choices. Without understanding the fundamentals of the investments, investors may not be able to identify potential risks and make informed decisions.

Lastly, high fees and expenses can eat into an investor's returns over time. If an investor chooses high-cost investment products or pays excessive fees to advisors, it can significantly impact their overall returns.

Overall, the average investor can lose money due to emotional decision-making, lack of diversification, lack of knowledge, and high fees and expenses.

This next point sounds obvious, but remember that you pay a commission on every trade regardless of profit, so every trade you make that you make at a loss also costs you commissions. Even if you make trades that are profitable more often than not, if you make quite a few trades with small amounts like this, your commissions may eat away all of your profits. Commissions represent a fixed cost, so their effect on your gains decreases proportionally with the amount of money you place at risk in each trade. Since you\'re in the US, you\'re required to follow the SEC rules on pattern day trading. From that link, """"FINRA rules define a “pattern day trader” as any customer who executes four or more “day trades” within five business days, provided that the number of day trades represents more than six percent of the customer’s total trades in the margin account for that same five business day period."""" If you trip this rule, you\'ll be required to maintain $25,000 in a margin brokerage account. If you can\'t maintain the balance, your account will be locked. Don\'t forget about capital gains taxes. Since you\'re holding these securities for less than a year, your gains will be taxed at your ordinary income tax rates. You can deduct your capital losses too (assuming you don\'t repurchase the same security within 30 days, because in that case, the wash sale rule prevents you from deducting the loss), but it\'s important to think about gains and losses in real terms, not nominal terms. The story is different if you make these trades in a tax-sheltered account like an IRA, but the other problems still apply. You\'re implicitly assuming that the stock\'s prices are skewed in the positive direction. Remember that you have limit orders placed at the upper and lower bounds of the range, so if the stock price decreases before it increases, your limit order at the lower bound will be triggered and you\'ll trade at a loss. If you\'re hoping to make a profit through buying low and selling high, you want a stock that hits its upper bound before hitting the lower bound the majority of the time. Unless you have data analysis (not just your intuition or a pattern you\'ve talked yourself into from looking at a chart) to back this up, you\'re essentially gambling that more often than not, the stock price will increase before it decreases. It\'s dangerous to use any strategy that you haven\'t backtested extensively. Find several months or years of historical data, either intra-day or daily data, depending on the time frame you\'re using to trade, and simulate your strategy exactly. This helps you determine the potential profitability of your strategy, and it also forces you to decide on a plan for precisely when you want to invest. Do you invest as soon as the stock trades in a range (which algorithms can determine far better than intuition)? It also helps you figure out how to manage your risk and how much loss you\'re willing to accept. For risk management, using limit orders is a start, but see my point above about positively skewed prices. Limit orders aren\'t enough. In general, if an active investment strategy seems like a """"no-brainer"""" or too good to be true, it\'s probably not viable. In general, as a retail investor, it\'s foolish to assume that no one else has thought of your simple active strategy to make easy money. I can promise you that someone has thought of it. Trading firms have quantitative researchers that are paid to think of and implement trading strategies all the time.  If it\'s viable at any scale, they\'ll probably already have utilized it and arbitraged away the potential for small traders to make significant gains. Trust me, you\'re not the first person who thought of using limit orders to make """"easy money"""" off volatile stocks. The fact that you\'re asking here and doing research before implementing this strategy, however, means that you\'re on the right track. It\'s always wise to research a strategy extensively before deploying it in the wild. To answer the question in your title, since it could be interpreted a little differently than the body of the question: No, there\'s nothing wrong with investing in volatile stocks, indexes, etc. I certainly do, and I\'m sure many others on this site do as well. It\'s not the investing that gets you into trouble and costs you a lot of money; it\'s the rapid buying and selling and attempting to time the market that proves costly, which is what you\'re doing when you implicitly bet that the distribution of the stock\'s prices is positively skewed. To address the commission fee problem, assuming a fee of $8 per trade ... and a minimum of $100 profit per sale Commissions aren\'t your only problem, and counting on $100 profit per sale is a significant assumption. Look at point #4 above. Through your use of limit orders, you\'re making the implicit assumption that, more often than not, the price will trigger your upper limit order before your lower limit order. Here\'s a simple example; let\'s assume you have limit orders placed at +2 and -2 of your purchase price, and that triggering the limit order at +2 earns you $100 profit, while triggering the limit order at -2 incurs a loss of $100. Assume your commission is $5 on each trade.  If your upper limit order is triggered, you earn a profit of 100 - 10 = 90, then set up the same set of limit orders again. If your lower limit order is triggered this time, you incur a loss of 100 + 10 = 110, so your net gain is 90 - 110 = -20. This is a perfect example of why, when taking into account transaction costs, even strategies that at first glance seem profitable mathematically can actually fail.  If you set up the same situation again and incur a loss again (100 + 10 = 110), you\'re now down -20 - 110 = -130. To make a profit, you need to make two profitable trades, without incurring further losses.  This is why point #4 is so important. Whenever you trade, it\'s critical to completely understand the risk you\'re taking and the bet you\'re actually making, not just the bet you think you\'re making. Also, according to my """"algorithm"""" a sale only takes place once the stock rises by 1 or 2 points; otherwise the stock is held until it does. Does this mean you\'ve removed the lower limit order? If yes, then you expose yourself to downside risk. What if the stock has traded within a range, then suddenly starts declining because of bad earnings reports or systemic risks (to name a few)? If you haven\'t removed the lower limit order, then point #4 still stands.  However, I never specified that the trades have to be done within the same day.  Let the investor open up 5 brokerage accounts at 5 different firms (for safeguarding against being labeled a """"Pattern Day Trader""""). Each account may only hold 1 security at any time, for the span of 1 business week. How do you control how long the security is held? You\'re using limit orders, which will be triggered when the stock price hits a certain level, regardless of when that happens. Maybe that will happen within a week, or maybe it will happen within the same day. Once again, the bet you\'re actually making is different from the bet you think you\'re making. Can you provide some algorithms or methods that do work for generating some extra cash on the side, aside from purchasing S&P 500 type index funds and waiting? When I purchase index funds, it\'s not to generate extra liquid cash on the side. I don\'t invest nearly enough to be able to purchase an index fund and earn substantial dividends. I don\'t want to get into any specific strategies because I\'m not in the business of making investment recommendations, and I don\'t want to start. Furthermore, I don\'t think explicit investment recommendations are welcome here (unless it\'s describing why something is a bad idea), and I agree with that policy. I will make a couple of points, however. Understand your goals. Are you investing for retirement or a shorter horizon, e.g. some side income? You seem to know this already, but I include it for future readers.  If a strategy seems too good to be true, it probably is. Educate yourself before designing a strategy. Research fundamental analysis, different types of orders (e.g., so you fully understand that you don\'t have control over when limit orders are executed), different sectors of the market if that\'s where your interests lie, etc. Personally, I find some sectors fascinating, so researching them thoroughly allows me to make informed investment decisions as well as learn about something that interests me. Understand your limits. How much money are you willing to risk and possibly lose? Do you have a risk management strategy in place to prevent unexpected losses? What are the costs of the risk management itself? Backtest, backtest, backtest. Ideally your backtesting and simulating should be identical to actual market conditions and incorporate all transaction costs and a wide range of historical data. Get other opinions. Evaluate those opinions with the same critical eye as I and others have evaluated your proposed strategy.""'

 ""Its hard to write much in those comment boxes, so I'll just make an answer, although its really not a formal answer. Regarding commissions, it costs me $5 per trade, so that's actually $10 per trade ($5 to buy, $5 to sell).  An ETF like TNA ($58 per share currently) fluctuates $1 or $2 per day.  IXC is $40 per share and fluctuates nearly 50 cents per day (a little less).  So to make any decent money per trade would mean a share size of 50 shares TNA which means I need $2900 in cash (TNA is not marginable). If it goes up $1 and I sell, that's $10 for the broker and $40 for me.  I would consider this to be the minimum share size for TNA.  For IXC, 100 shares would cost me $4000 / 2 = $2000 since IXC is marginable.  If IXC goes up 50 cents, that's $10 for the broker and $40 for me.  IXC also pays a decent dividend.  TNA does not.  You'll notice the amount of cash needed to capture these gains is roughly the same. (Actually, to capture daily moves in IXC, you'll need a bit more than $2000 because it doesn't vary quite a full 50 cents each day). At first, I thought you were describing range trading or stock channeling, but those systems require stop losses when the range or channel is broken.  You're now talking about holding forever until you get 1 or 2 points of profit.  Therefore, I wouldn't trade stocks at all.  Stocks could go to zero, ETFs will not.  It seems to me you're looking for a way to generate small, consistent returns and you're not seeking to strike it rich in one trade.  Therefore, buying something that pays a dividend would be a good idea if you plan to hold forever while waiting for your 1 or 2 points. In your system you're also going to have to define when to get back in the trade.  If you buy IXC now at $40 and it goes to $41 and you sell, do you wait for it to come back to $40?  What if it never does?  Are you happy with having only made one trade for $40 profit in your lifetime?  What if it goes up to $45 and then dips to $42, do you buy at $42?  If so, what stops you from eventually buying at the tippy top?  Or even worse, what stops you from feeling even more confident at the top and buying bigger lots?  If it gets to $49, surely it will cover that last buck to $50, right? /sarc What if you bought IXC at $40 and it went down.  Now what?  Do you take up gardening as a hobby while waiting for IXC to come back?  Do you buy more at lower prices and average down?  Do you find other stocks to trade?  If so, how long until you run out of money and you start getting margin calls?  Then you'll be forced to sell at the bottom when you should be buying more. All these systems seem easy, but when you actually get in there and try to use them, you'll find they're not so easy.  Anything that is obvious, won't work anymore.  And even when you find something that is obvious and bet that it stops working, you'll be wrong then too.  The thing is, if you think of it, many others just like you also think of it... therefore it can't work because everyone can't make money in stocks just like everyone at the poker table can't make money.  If you can make 1% or 2% per day on your money, that's actually quite good and not too many people can do that.  Or maybe its better to say, if you can make 2% per trade, and not take a 50% loss per 10 trades, you're doing quite well. If you make $40 per trade profit while working with $2-3k and you do that 50 times per year (50 trades is not a lot in a year), you've doubled your money for the year.  Who does that on a consistent basis?  To expect that kind of performance is just unrealistic.  It much easier to earn $2k with $100k than it is to double $2k in a year.  In stocks, money flows TO those who have it and FROM those who don't. You have to plan for all possibilities, form a system then stick to it, and not take on too much risk or expect big (unrealistic) rewards. Daytrading You make 4 roundtrips in 5 days, that broker labels you a pattern daytrader.  Once you're labeled, its for life at that brokerage.  If you switch to a new broker, the new broker doesn't know your dealings with the old broker, therefore you'll have to establish a new pattern with the new broker in order to be labeled.  If the SEC were to ask, the broker would have to say 'yes' or 'no' concering if you established a pattern of daytrading at that brokerage. Suppose you make the 4 roundtrips and then you make a 5th that triggers the call.  The broker will call you up and say you either need to deposit enough to bring your account to $25k or you need to never make another daytrade at that firm... ever!  That's the only warning you'll ever get.  If you're in violation again, they lock your account to closing positions until you send in funds to bring the balance up to $25k.  All you need to do is have the money hit your account, you can take it right back out again.  Once your account has $25k, you're allowed to trade again.... even if you remove $15k of it that same day.  If you trigger the call again, you have to send the $15k back in, then take it back out. Having the label is not all bad... they give you 4x margin.  So with $25k, you can buy $100k of marginable stock.  I don't know... that could be a bad thing too.  You could get a margin call at the end of the day for owning $100k of stock when you're only allowed to own $50k overnight.  I believe that's a fed call and its a pretty big deal.""
 ""The strategy has intrinsic value, which may or may not be obstructed in practice by details mentioned in other answers (tax and other overheads, regulation, risk). John Bensin says that as a general principle, if a simple technical analysis is good then someone will have implemented it before you. That's fair, but we can do better than an existence proof for this particular case, we can point to who is doing approximately this. Market makers are already doing this with different numbers. They quote a buy price and a sell price on the same stock, so they are already buying low and selling high with a small margin. If your strategy works in practice, that means you can make low-risk money from short-term volatility that they're missing out on, by setting your margin at approximately the daily price variation instead of the current bid-offer spread. But market makers choose their own bid-offer spread, and they choose it because they think it's the best margin to make low-risk money in the long run.

On one hand, investing in such stocks can provide opportunities for short-term gains. Traders who engage in day trading or short-term speculation may find these fluctuations advantageous for making quick profits. They can buy stocks at a low price and sell them when they rise by a few points, generating a small but immediate profit.

On the other hand, investing in stocks that fluctuate by single points throughout the day can be risky and unpredictable. These stocks are often more volatile, and their price movements can be driven by short-term market noise, news, or speculation rather than the underlying fundamentals of the company. This makes it harder to accurately predict their future performance, making long-term investing strategies more challenging.

Additionally, constantly monitoring and trading stocks that fluctuate by single points throughout the day can be time-consuming and require active management. This may not be suitable for all investors, particularly those who prefer a more passive or long-term investment approach.

Ultimately, the suitability of investing in such stocks depends on an individual's investment goals, risk tolerance, and time commitment.

 '""The psychology of investing is fascinating. I buy a stock that\'s out of favor at $10, and sell half at a 400% profit, $50/share.

The $10 purchase was risky as Apple pre-iPod wasn\'t a company that was guaranteed to survive.  The only intelligent advice I can offer is to look at your holdings frequently, and ask, """"would I buy this stock today given its fundamentals and price?"""" If you wouldn\'t buy it, you shouldn\'t hold it. (This is in contrast to the company ratings you see of buy, hold, sell. If I should hold it, but you shouldn\'t buy it to hold, that makes no sense to me.) Disclaimer - I am old and have decided stock picking is tough.

There is no explicit upper bound on a market, and even if individual companies\' values were remaining unchanged one would expect the market to drift upward in the long term.

Trying to time the market -- to guess when it\'s going to move in any particular direction -- is usually closer to gambling than investing. The simplest answer remains a combination of buy-and-hold and dollar-cost averaging. Buy at a constant number of dollars per month (or whatever frequency you prefer), and you will automatically buy more when the stock/fund is lower, less when it is higher. That takes advantage of downturns as buying opportunities without missing out on possible gains at the other end. Personally, I add a bit of contrarian buying to that -- I increased my buying another notch or two while the market was depressed, since I had money I wouldn\'t need any time soon (buy and hold) and I was reasonably confident that enough of the market would come back strongly enough that I wasn\'t at significant risk of losing the investment.

"Any reason to keep around my account with my old, 'big' bank?","['""From my experience, payments from banks and other financial entities, such as loyalty programs, generally aren\'t as large as payments that go the other direction from consumer to bank. Thus, keeping a bank account open simply for some reward/loyalty points may just be changing your behavior for the wrong reasons. The more important scenario is whether or not you have any automated ACH payments or whether your bank account is linked to other services. Perhaps the biggest tell that you\'re in the clear is when those transactions start occurring from your credit union account.  For example: If you had a direct deposit to your BMO bank account, make sure you see deposits start to appear in the credit union account. If you\'re making automatic withdraws to an online savings or brokerage account, make sure those transfers are stopped and that you instead see them coming out of your new credit union account.

Also, most smaller banks don't have international toll free (in-country) numbers for foreign access. Smaller banks also tend to have less sophisticated business banking tools and experience.

2. Branch and ATM network: Big banks usually have a larger physical presence with branches and ATMs, which can be beneficial if you prefer in-person banking services.

3. Product offerings: Big banks often offer a wide range of financial products and services, including investment options, loans, and credit cards, which might suit your specific needs.

4. Technology and digital services: Although smaller institutions are catching up, big banks usually have more advanced online and mobile banking platforms, providing convenient access to your accounts.

5. Established reputation: Big banks often have long-standing reputations and may be seen as more stable and reliable by some individuals.

Ultimately, the decision to keep your account with a big bank should depend on your personal preferences, banking needs, and any associated fees or limitations. It may be worth exploring other options and comparing them to ensure you're getting the best banking experience.","From the given context, there are a few reasons to consider keeping your account with your old, 'big' bank:

1. Automated ACH payments: If you have any automated ACH payments or if your bank account is linked to other services, such as direct deposits or automatic withdrawals, it would be important to keep the account open until you can transfer those transactions to your new credit union account.

2. Payment processing fees: If you have any upcoming bills or payments due in the next 6 months, it might be beneficial to keep your old account open until you can switch those payments to your new account. This will help you avoid any potential late fees or payment processing fees.

3. Liabilities and assets at different locations: Some financial advisors recommend keeping liabilities and assets at different locations. This can provide an extra layer of protection in case of any financial difficulties. If you have any loans or liabilities with your old bank, it might be wise to keep the account open for easier payment management.

Ultimately, the decision to keep your account with your old bank depends on your specific financial situation and needs. It may be helpful to evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of keeping the account open and determine if it aligns with your financial goals.","['""From my experience, payments from banks and other financial entities, such as loyalty programs, generally aren\'t as large as payments that go the other direction from consumer to bank. Thus, keeping a bank account open simply for some reward/loyalty points may just be changing your behavior for the wrong reasons. The more important scenario is whether or not you have any automated ACH payments or whether your bank account is linked to other services. Perhaps the biggest tell that you\'re in the clear is when those transactions start occurring from your credit union account.  For example: If you had a direct deposit to your BMO bank account, make sure you see deposits start to appear in the credit union account. If you\'re making automatic withdraws to an online savings or brokerage account, make sure those transfers are stopped and that you instead see them coming out of your new credit union account. You shouldn\'t need to move the auto loan, but you will need to make sure you can pay it from the new account.  Some financial advisors, such as in this BankRate article titled, Lenders can tap bank account for mortgage, even recommend keeping liabilities and assets at different locations. If for whatever reason your financial situation turned bleak, it would be more difficult for the bank to help itself to what\'s in your checking account. To avoid getting nickel and dimed to death by """"payment processing fees"""", I tend to pay insurance bills yearly or semi-annually. Thus, consider if there is anything that may be coming due in the next 6 months. If so, you might want to get your new account hooked up while you still have all the routing numbers and account numbers in your head. It\'s a pain to dig this stuff up while also rushing to not be late. If all that is in order, close the account.""'
 ""First, what's the reason? Why do you have that much in cash at all - are you concerned about market volatility, are you planning to buy a house, do you have tens of millions of dollars and this is your slush fund?  Are you a house flipper and this is part of business for you? If you need the money for short term use - ie, you're buying a house in cash next month - then as long as you're in a sound bank (one of the big national ones, for example) it seems reasonable.  You can never predict a crash like 2008, but it seems unlikely that Chase or Citibank will go under in the next few weeks. If you like to have a cash position, then split the money among multiple banks.  Buy a CD at one major bank with some of the amount.  My in-laws have a trust which is partially invested in CDs, and they use multiple banks for this purpose to keep their accounts fully insured.  Each separate bank you're covered up to 250k, so if you have $150k at Chase and $150k at a local bank, you're covered.  (You're also covered in a much larger amount - up to 1MM potentially - if you are married, as you can have a separate account each for $250k and a joint account up to $500k.) Otherwise, why do you have that much in cash?  You should invest it in something that will return more than inflation, at a minimum... Edit post-clarifications: $350k is around my level of 'Maybe, maybe not'.  You're risking $100k on a pretty low risk (assuming this isn't a small local bank, and even those are pretty low still).  In order to remove that risk you have to do something active - ie, take 100k somewhere else, open a new bank account, etc. - which isn't exactly the hardest thing in the world, but it does take effort.  Is it worth the 0.001% chance (entirely made up) you lose the 100k?  That's $10, if you agree with that risk chance.  Up to you. It wouldn't be particularly hard, though, to open an account with an online bank, deposit $100k in there in a 6 month CD, then pay the IRS from your other account and when the 6 month CD expires take the cash back into your active account.  Assuming you're not planning on buying a house in the next six months this should be fine, I'd think (and even then you'd still have $150k for the downpayment up front, which is enough to buy a $750k house w/o PMI). Additionally, as several commenters note: if you can reasonably do so, and your money won't be making significant interest, you might choose to pay your taxes now rather than later.  This removes the risk entirely; the likely small interest you earn over 3 months may be similar to the amount you'd spend (mostly of your time, plus possibly actual expenses) moving it to another bank.  If you're making 2% or 3% this may not be true, but if you're in a 0.25% account like my accounts are, $100k * 0.25% * 0.25 is $62.50, after all.""
 'Another thing to factor in are deals provided by banks. In general, banks care about new customers more than their existing customers. Hence they explicitly restrict the best deals on credit cards, savings accounts, etc, to new customers only. (Of course, there are occasionally good deals for existing customers, and some banks choose not to discriminate.) If you have many different bank accounts, you are making yourself unavailable for switching bonuses and introductory rates.'
 ""I don't think there's any law against having lots of bank accounts. But what are you really gaining? Every new account is a paperwork hassle. Every new account is another target for con men who might steal your information and write bad checks or make phony credit card purchases in your name. Yes, it's not unreasonable to have a credit card or two that you keep for emergencies. I'd advise anyone with running up debts while having no idea how you will pay them off. But to say that you might keep some credit available so that if you have a legitimate emergency -- like, say, your car breaks down and you don't have the cash to fix it and you can't get to work without it -- you have some a fallback. But do you really need ten credit cards for that sort of thing? And how much credit are they giving you on each card? I don't know how the banks work this, but I'd think if they're rational, they'd consider your total credit before giving you more.  I have three credit cards that I use regularly -- two personal and one business. And I find that a real pain to keep track of, to make sure that I keep each one paid by the due date and to keep a handle on how much I owe and so forth. I can't imagine trying to deal with ten. I suppose you could just stuff all these cards in a drawer and only use them in case of emergency.""]"

Capital improvement and depreciation in restaurant LLC,"[""First, you should probably have a proper consultation with a licensed tax adviser (EA/CPA licensed in your State). In fact you should have had it before you started, but that ship has sailed. You're talking about start-up expenses. You can generally deduct up to $5000 in the year your business starts, and the expenses in excess will be amortized over 180 months (15 years). This is per the IRC Sec. 195. The amortization starts when your business is active (i.e.: you can buy the property, but not actually open the restaurant - you cannot start the depreciation). I have a couple questions about accounting - should all the money I   spent be a part of capital spending? Or is it just a part of it? If it qualifies as start-up/organizational expenses - it should be capitalized. If it is spent on capital assets - then it should also be capitalized, but for different reasons and differently. For example, costs of filing paperwork for permits is a start-up expense. Buying a commercial oven is a capital asset purchase which should be depreciated separately, as buying the tables and silverware. If it is a salary expense to your employees - then it is a current expense and shouldn't be capitalized. Our company is LLC if this matters.  It matters to how it affects your personal tax return.""]","Capital improvement and depreciation in a restaurant LLC will depend on the specific expenses incurred. Start-up and organizational expenses should be capitalized, while expenses related to capital assets such as purchasing equipment should also be capitalized for different reasons. These capital assets, including commercial ovens, tables, and silverware, should be depreciated over time. However, salary expenses for employees are considered current expenses and should not be capitalized. The fact that the company is an LLC may have implications for how these expenses affect personal tax returns.","Capital improvement refers to the process of making significant enhancements or renovations to a restaurant LLC's physical property or assets. These improvements are intended to increase the value, functionality, or overall appeal of the establishment. Examples of capital improvements in a restaurant may include remodeling the dining area, upgrading kitchen equipment, or installing a new HVAC system.

Depreciation, on the other hand, is the gradual decrease in the value of an asset over time due to wear and tear, obsolescence, or other factors. In the context of a restaurant LLC, depreciation is typically applied to tangible assets such as furniture, equipment, and buildings. By recognizing depreciation, the restaurant LLC can account for the gradual loss in value of its assets and allocate appropriate expenses for tax and financial reporting purposes.

Both capital improvement and depreciation play important roles in the financial management of a restaurant LLC. Capital improvements can enhance the overall customer experience, attract more patrons, and increase revenue potential. On the other hand, recognizing depreciation allows the restaurant LLC to accurately reflect the true value of its assets and allocate expenses accordingly.

It's important for restaurant LLC owners and managers to carefully plan and budget for capital improvements, considering their potential impact on the business's financial statements and cash flow. Additionally, proper depreciation accounting ensures that the restaurant LLC is accurately reporting its net income and asset values, which can have implications for tax planning and financial decision-making.","In a restaurant LLC, capital improvements and depreciation are important aspects of accounting and tax planning. Capital improvements refer to significant investments made to enhance the value or extend the useful life of a property or asset. Examples in a restaurant context could include renovations, expansions, or the purchase of expensive equipment.

When capital improvements are made in a restaurant LLC, they are typically capitalized, meaning the costs are added to the basis of the property or asset. This allows for the expenses to be depreciated over time, rather than being fully deducted in the year they are incurred.

Depreciation is the process of allocating the cost of a capital asset over its useful life. In the case of a restaurant LLC, this would involve spreading out the cost of the capital improvements over a predetermined period, typically through annual depreciation deductions.

It is important to consult with a licensed tax adviser or accountant who is familiar with the specific tax laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. They can provide guidance on how to properly account for capital improvements and depreciation in your restaurant LLC, ensuring compliance with tax regulations and maximizing your tax benefits.","[""First, you should probably have a proper consultation with a licensed tax adviser (EA/CPA licensed in your State).

 'Keep this rather corny acronym in mind. Business expenses must be CORN: As other posters have already pointed out, certain expenses that are capital items (computers, furniture, etc.) must be depreciated over several years, but you have a certain amount of capital items that you can write off in the current tax year.'
 ""First of all, Dilip's answer explains well how the business deductions generally work. For most (big) expenses you depreciate it. However, in some cases you need to capitalize it, which is another accounting method. When you capitalize your expense, it becomes part of the basis of the product you're creating. Since you're an engineer, this might be relevant for you. Talk to your tax adviser. How exactly you deduct/depreciate/capitalize things, and what expense goes which way depends greatly on the laws and jurisdictions. Even in the US, different states have different laws, and the IRS and State laws don't have to conform (unfortunately). For example, the limitations on Sec. 179 deduction in 2010-2011 were 20 times higher on Federal level than in the State of California. This could have lead to cases where you fully deducted your expense on your Federal tax return, but need to continue and depreciate it on your State return (or vice versa). Good tax adviser is crucial to avoid or manage these cases.""
 '""There are TWO parts to an LLC or any company structure.  This being the entire point of creating an LLC.

The IRS has a word for single member LLCs: """"Disregarded entity"""".  The IRS wants to know that the entity exists and it\'s connected to you.

Instead, whoever is handling your estate will need to obtain copies of your death certificate and they will then search your paper records to identify all accounts (reason to get your act together - there are books on the subject).  The executor will work with the banks and card companies to make sure all your charges and payments clear (common to have them open for months or even a year) and to make close or transfer autopays.

In fact, you could even cut them up but not close the accounts - I had an account open that I didn't possess a physical card for several years for and didn't use at all, and it stayed open (though it's not guaranteed they'll keep it open for you if you never use it).   In an emergency you could then ask them to send you a new copy of the card very easily.  But, keep them, just in case you need them. Once you have paid off your balances on your balance-carrying cards, then you should consider closing some of them.

 ""Generally speaking the bank accounts and credit card accounts remain open.  Banks and the credit card companies don't monitor public records on a daily basis.  Instead, whoever is handling your estate will need to obtain copies of your death certificate and they will then search your paper records to identify all accounts (reason to get your act together - there are books on the subject).  The executor will work with the banks and card companies to make sure all your charges and payments clear (common to have them open for months or even a year) and to make close or transfer autopays.  They will make sure to notify the credit agencies to flag your accounts so no new accounts can be created.  MANY copies of the death certicates are needed.""
 ""Yes.  For $15 it's not worth anyone's time to dig deep just for this specific occurrence. What you should do, however, is keep an eye on your credit card bills and accounts and watch for any other suspicious activity.  It is possible that your number was stolen somehow and someone is using it fraudulently, so you want to be on the lookout in case they try to use it again.  However, your credit card company is going to be much, much better than you at detecting patterns of fraud, which is why you should leave it to them unless and until you actually see more suspicious activity.""
 ""I'm not sure if someone else answered already in the same manner I will. I can't guarantee for sure if it's the same in the U.S.A. (it might since major credit cards companies like Visa/MC/AMEX are American companies) but in Canada having/keeping unused CC is a disadvantage because of the following: Banks and financing companies look more at the total amount of credit available to you than at how much purchases you have on your cards. Ex: Let's say that you have the following: - Visa cc with $10,000 limit and $2000 worth of purchases (made more than 30 days ago) on it. - Mastercard cc with $10,000 limit as well and $1000 worth of purchases (less than 30 days old) - A major retail store cc with $2000 limit and $0 balance. Hypothetical situation: You want a bank loan to do some expensive house repairs and are looking for a lower interest rate than what your cc can offer. The bank will not care about the amount on the cards. They will add-up all the limits of your cc and treat your loan request as if ALL your cards were filled to their respective limit.  So in this case: they will consider you as being right now in debt of $10K+$10K+$2K = $22,000 instead of only $3000 and they might:  1. refuse you the loan 2. grant it only if you transfer all purchases on a single card and cancel all the others. 3. Once the $3000 is transferred on one of the cards (and the others cancelled), they can require that you reduce the limit of that card. Hope this helps!""]"

This will allow you to track the finances of each LLC individually. However, it is worth considering whether using QuickBooks for the LLCs that only hold property and pay utilities is necessary. In some cases, tracking their finances on a spreadsheet may be sufficient. Keep in mind that subsidiary companies will likely appear as assets on the parent company's books. While this setup may provide some level of liability protection, it will also create additional overhead and expenses. Consider the implications for tax filing, insurance policies, and overall costs before proceeding with this setup.","To set up Quickbooks for a small property rental company that holds its properties in separate LLCs, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a Chart of Accounts: Start by setting up a Chart of Accounts in Quickbooks. This will help you organize your financial transactions and separate them by property and LLC. Create different accounts for income, expenses, assets, liabilities, and equity for each LLC.

2. Set up Company Information: Enter the company information for each LLC separately. This includes the name, address, contact information, and tax identification number for each LLC.

3. Add Customers and Vendors: Create separate customer records for each tenant or property for easy tracking of rental income. Also, add vendor records for any contractors, suppliers, or service providers associated with each property or LLC.

4. Track Rental Income: Set up separate income accounts for each LLC to track rental income. When recording rental payments, assign them to the corresponding income account based on the property or LLC they belong to.

5. Record Expenses: Create expense accounts for each LLC to track expenses associated with each property separately. Categorize expenses based on property maintenance, repairs, utilities, insurance, property taxes, etc. Ensure that you allocate expenses to the correct LLC when recording them.

6. Manage Bank Accounts: Set up separate bank accounts for each LLC and link them to Quickbooks. This will help you reconcile transactions and keep track of property-specific financials.

7. Generate Reports: Utilize Quickbooks' reporting features to generate financial reports for each LLC. This will provide you with an accurate overview of the financial health of each property and LLC.

8. Reconcile and Periodic Review: Regularly reconcile bank accounts, review financial statements, and ensure all transactions are accurately recorded and categorized. This will help maintain accurate books for each LLC and aid in tax preparation.

Remember, it's essential to consult with a professional accountant or bookkeeper with experience in real estate accounting to ensure compliance with tax laws and best practices for your specific situation.","To set up QuickBooks for a small property rental company that holds its properties in separate LLCs, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Create a separate company file for each LLC: In QuickBooks, you need one company file for each company you want to track. Create a new company file for each LLC that holds the properties.

2. Set up the chart of accounts: Customize the chart of accounts in each company file to reflect the specific accounts and categories relevant to each LLC. This will help you track income, expenses, and other financial transactions for each property separately.

3. Enter property details: Enter the details of each property, such as address, purchase price, and any other relevant information, in the respective company file. This will help you keep track of each property's financials.

 ""Insurance - get estimate from an insurance agent who works with policies for commercial real estate.  See comments below regarding incorporation. Taxes - if this was basic income for a simple LLC, estimating 25-40% and adjusting over time might work.  Rental property is a whole different prospect.  Financial experts who specialize in rental properties would be a good source of advice, and worth the cost.  See below regarding incorporating. Real estate appreciation - not something you can count on for developed property.  Appreciation used to be almost guaranteed to at least keep up with inflation.  Now property values are not even guaranteed to go up.  Never have been but the general rule was improved real estate in good repair appreciated in price.  Even if property values increase over time, rental properties depreciate.  In fact, for rental properties, you can claim a certain rate of depreciation over time as an expense on taxes.  This depreciation could mean selling for less than you paid for the property after a number of years, and owing capital gains taxes, since you would owe the difference between the depreciated value and the sale price. Related to taxes are local codes.  Some areas require you to have a property management license to handle buildings with more than a certain number of units. If you are going to own rental properties, you should protect your private financial life by incorporating.  Form a company.  The company will own the property and hire any maintenance people or property managers or security staff or any similar employment activities.  The company takes out the insurance and pays taxes.  The company can pay you a salary.  So, bottom line, you can have the company pay all the expenses and take all the risks.  Then, assuming there's any money left after expenses, the company can pay you a manager's salary.  That way if the worst happens and a tenant breaks their hip in the shower and sues you for ONE MILLION DOLLARS and wins, the company folds and you walk away.  You might even consider two companies.  One to own the property and lease it to a property management company.  The property management company can then go bankrupt in case of some sort of liability issue, in which case you still keep the property, form a new management company, repaint and rename the property and move on. TL;DR:  Get insurance advice from insurance agent before you buy.  Same for taxes from an accountant.  Get trained as a property manager if your local codes require it (might be a good idea anyway).  Incorporate and have the company take all the risks.""

 ""As a new (very!) small business, the IRS has lots of advice and information for you. Start at https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed and be sure you have several pots of coffee or other appropriate aid against somnolence.  By default a single-member LLC is 'disregarded' for tax purposes (at least for Federal, and generally states follow Federal although I don't know Mass. specifically), although it does have other effects. If you go this route you simply include the business income and expenses on Schedule C as part of your individual return on 1040, and the net SE income is included along with your other income (if any) in computing your tax. TurboTax or similar software should handle this for you, although you may need a premium version that costs a little more.  You can 'elect' to have the LLC taxed as a corporation by filing form 8832, see https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/limited-liability-company-llc . In principle you are supposed to do this when the entity is 'formed', but in practice AIUI if you do it by the end of the year they won't care at all, and if you do it after the end of the year but before or with your first affected return you qualify for automatic 'relief'. However, deciding how to divide the business income/profits into 'reasonable pay' to yourself versus 'dividends' is more complicated, and filling out corporation tax returns in addition to your individual return (which is still required) is more work, in addition to the work and cost of filing and reporting the LLC itself to your state of choice. Unless/until you make something like $50k-100k a year this probably isn't worth it. 1099 Reporting. Stripe qualifies as a 'payment network' and under a recent law payment networks must annually report to IRS (and copy to you) on form 1099-K if your account exceeds certain thresholds; see https://support.stripe.com/questions/will-i-receive-a-1099-k-and-what-do-i-do-with-it  . Note you are still legally required to report and pay tax on your SE income even if you aren't covered by 1099-K (or other) reporting. Self-employment tax. As a self-employed person (if the LLC is disregarded) you have to pay 'SE' tax that is effectively equivalent to the 'FICA' taxes that would be paid by your employer and you as an employee combined. This is 12.4% for Social Security unless/until your total earned income exceeds a cap (for 2017 $127,200, adjusted yearly for inflation), and 2.9% for Medicare with no limit (plus 'Additional Medicare' tax if you exceed a higher threshold and it isn't 'repealed and replaced'). If the LLC elects corporation status it has to pay you reasonable wages for your services, and withhold+pay FICA on those wages like any other employer. Estimated payments. You are required to pay most of your individual income tax, and SE tax if applicable, during the year (generally 90% of your tax or your tax minus $1,000 whichever is less). Most wage-earners don't notice this because it happens automatically through payroll withholding, but as self-employed you are responsible for making sufficient and timely estimated payments, and will owe a penalty if you don't. However, since this is your first year you may have a 'safe harbor'; if you also have income from an employer (reported on W-2, with withholding) and that withholding is sufficent to pay last year's tax, then you are exempt from the 'underpayment' penalty for this year.  If you elect corporation status then the corporation (which is really just you) must always make timely payments of withheld amounts, according to one of several different schedules that may apply depending on the amounts; I believe it also must make estimated payments for its own liability, if any, but I'm not familiar with that part.""]"

These are properties they foreclosed on and depending how they are carrying them, you might find decent opportunities. As a matter of logic, a local bank that owns these specific properties (as compared to debt pools where big banks have piles of paper owned fractionally) are more willing to get a new owner in and paying a new loan.  Congrats on the new, higher, income. I'd suggest you first build the emergency fund before the downpayment fund. Let us know how it goes.""]"
Freelancer: Should I start a second bank account?,"[""I feel the need to separate my freelance accounts from my personal accounts. Yes, you should. Should I start another savings account or a current account? Do you need the money for daily spending? Do you need to re-invest in your business? Use a current account. If you don't need the money for business expenses, put it away in your savings account or even consider term deposits. Don't rule out a hybrid approach either (some in savings account, some in current account). What criteria should I keep in mind while choosing a bank? (I thought of SBI since it has a lot of branches and ATMs). If you are involved in online banking and that is sufficient for most of your needs, bank and ATM locations shouldn't matter all that much. If you are saving a good chunk of money, you want to at least have that keep up with inflation. Research bank term deposit interest rates. The tend to be higher than just having your money sit in a savings account. Again, it depends on how and when you expect to need the money. What do I keep in mind while paying myself? Paying yourself could have tax implications. This depends on how are set up to freelance. Are you a business entity or are you an individual? You should look in to the following in India: The other thing to consider is rewarding yourself for the good work done. Pay yourself a reasonable amount. If you decide to expand and hire people going forward, you will have a better sense of business expenses involved when paying salaries. Tips on managing money in the business account. This is a very generic question. I can only provide a generic response. Know how much you are earning and how much your are putting back in to the business.

 'You should have a separate business account. Mixing business and personal funds is a bad practice. Shop around, you should be able to find a bank that will let you open a free checking account, especially if you are going to have minimal activity (e.g. less than 20 of checks per month) and perhaps maintain a small balance (e.g. $100 or $500).'
 ""If you're a sole proprietor there's no reason to have a separate business account, as long as you keep adequate records, as you are one and the same for tax purposes. My husband and I already have 5 accounts and a mortgage with one bank. I don't see the need to open up yet another account.  As a contracted accountant, I don't need to write business checks, and my expenses are minimal. As long as I have an present my assumed business name certificate and ID, there's no reason for a bank not to deposit into my personal account.""
 '""From my experience, payments from banks and other financial entities, such as loyalty programs, generally aren\'t as large as payments that go the other direction from consumer to bank. Thus, keeping a bank account open simply for some reward/loyalty points may just be changing your behavior for the wrong reasons. The more important scenario is whether or not you have any automated ACH payments or whether your bank account is linked to other services. Perhaps the biggest tell that you\'re in the clear is when those transactions start occurring from your credit union account.  For example: If you had a direct deposit to your BMO bank account, make sure you see deposits start to appear in the credit union account. If you\'re making automatic withdraws to an online savings or brokerage account, make sure those transfers are stopped and that you instead see them coming out of your new credit union account. You shouldn\'t need to move the auto loan, but you will need to make sure you can pay it from the new account.  Some financial advisors, such as in this BankRate article titled, Lenders can tap bank account for mortgage, even recommend keeping liabilities and assets at different locations. If for whatever reason your financial situation turned bleak, it would be more difficult for the bank to help itself to what\'s in your checking account. To avoid getting nickel and dimed to death by """"payment processing fees"""", I tend to pay insurance bills yearly or semi-annually. Thus, consider if there is anything that may be coming due in the next 6 months. If so, you might want to get your new account hooked up while you still have all the routing numbers and account numbers in your head. It\'s a pain to dig this stuff up while also rushing to not be late. If all that is in order, close the account.""']"
